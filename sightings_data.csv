11/19/2012 12:13,Circle,5 seconds,Cleveland, OH,41.45678541,-81.64169685,"I was outside on my backyard porch looking up into the sky: I then saw a circular shaped object, with bright lights, moving at speeds greater than any known military aircraft.  The UFO was seen for about 3 seconds with the bright lights visible and after that about 3 seconds it turned off the lights and while proceeding to travel in the same direction at the same speed. I could then still see a slight visual of the aircraft for about 2 more seconds.  Then that's when i no longer saw the aircraft."
11/19/2012 11:50,Disk,7 seconds,Saugerties/Kingston, NY,42.07793069,-73.95227014,"Rocking, slow moving disk high in sky visible due to reflected sunlight  I was traveling south on the New York State Thruway between exits 20 (Saugerties) and 19 (Kingston).  The sun was quite bright overhead - not visible to me.  Ahead of me were high flying clouds approaching from the south (they then totally dispersed, on the trip back they were nowhere to be seen.)  These were, again, HIGH flying clouds.  I was going 62 miles per hour (I know this because I watch my speedometer carefully and the car in front of me was a bit slower than usual).  I had reached (approximately) the mid-way point (mile marker 96-95) between Saugerties and Kingston exits which are eight miles from one another.  I&#8217;m unsure the exact direction since the road has many wide curves but it was the southbound lane (two lane thruway, I was in the right hand lane).  It was approximately 11:50 AM (I checked the car clock a couple of minutes later at 11:54).  I noticed a very bright, gleaming object reflecting sunlight.  It appeared in the sky immediately to my left in front of me (impossible to know how high it was.)  It was not low flying, it had no wings or rotors, and if it were at a cruising altitude of a commercial airliner, it would have been huge.  It flew much higher than a small plane could or any helicopter, it was not a dirigible or anything easily identifiable.  As directed, if I had to compare i! ts size to that of the sun (mid-day) it appeared flatter top and bottom, and perhaps 3/4 as wide.  It drifted &quot;slowly&quot; (in an easy manner) more toward the center of my windshield (this all took place in 7 to 10 seconds), stopped, rocked two times (like a plane rocking its wings) and slowly and smoothly went back to the original position.  It was metallic (which caused the sun to reflect off it as I stated) and shaped rather like a disc (saucer).  The road then curved widely and treed area came between me and that portion of the sky for several seconds (perhaps another eight) before I could get a glimpse of that piece of the sky again (which was extremely identifiable because of the formation of high flying clouds in an otherwise crystal blue sky).  The object was no longer visible.   When I reached my destination and parked, it so happened that the formation of clouds was directly in my line of vision.  I was able, standing still, to see that they were quite high.  A commercial jetliner was climbing to cruising altitude (I am 40 miles from both Albany and Newburgh airports, so planes climbing are commonly seen).  The plane appeared to be almost at cruising altitude and was quite high.  It entered the cloud structures and I lost sight of it.  I believe that the object I saw while driving also got &quot;lost&quot; into the cloud structure which explains why it was suddenly no longer visible (as the plane was suddenly no longer visible).  This suggests to me that the object I saw was flying as high as, or close to, the altitude of the commercial jetliner (since the same formation of clouds provided cover for both, once entered).   The most interesting aspect was the &quot;rocking,&quot; a lazy but precise maneuver, before it went back toward the direction where I had first seen it.  It was oval, as I said, rather like ( ) but with brackets top/bottom and very bright due to reflected sunlight.  It was obviously under control (the rocking indicates that to me) and was being deliberately maneuvered.   ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sincere in her description of her sighting.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD))"

11/19/2012 0:35,Triangle,7-10 seconds,New York City (Brooklyn), NY,43.1036548,-75.28995321,"Silent V-Shaped Craft seen flying over Brooklyn NY!  I live in Brooklyn, New York.  Right across the East River in Williamsburg, giving me a clean shot of the Lower East Side, Manhattan and the surrounding skyline from the roof top of my apartment building.  To the Northeast I can see the Queens-based La Guardia airport and almost directly South is JFK.  I sit outside a few times every night to have a cigarette and pay very close attention to the sky and I know what conventional aircraft look like.  Since it&#8217;s NYC I&#8217;ve seen plenty of military craft as well, aircraft that the normal Joe-Schmoe doesn&#8217;t see every day.  Anything from F16 Fighter Jets, Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopters (when the President is in town), Chinook helicopters and once I even saw an Osprey flying over the East River Harbor.  Long story short, I&#8217;m very used to seeing unconventional craft in the sky as well.  I stepped outside onto my roof for a cigarette around 12:30am, as I normally do (since I don&#8217;t smoke inside my apartment) and when I looked up, I noticed how bright the stars were.  There aren&#8217;t many nights in New York City when the stars are visible.  There wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky and I was enjoying being able to see Orion&#8217;s Belt as I puffed away.  Then it came into my line of vision.  A very mysterious craft or UFO that flew directly over my head!  Now I can see planes flying into both Airports nearby and not once has any commercial flight flown directly overhead of my building.  If this craft was the size of a normal commercial flight, then it was flying at a severely low altitude.   It was very hard to comprehend the size, especially because there was no noise.  If it was a large commercial flight then it was way too low for FAA regulations, especially this close to Ground Zero (9/11).  The best explanation from what I directly witnessed, is it was flying at a high alt! itude and was just immensely huge, possibly the length of a football field.  It was in my line of vision for around 7-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the Williamsburg Bridge.  I ran down the fire escape on the side of my building praying that I would catch a glimpse of it again once it passed the bridge, or at least see some FAA lights.  Nothing.  It was gone, as so were my chances to photograph it.  The best way to describe it is the typical V-Shape that is pretty common in UFO sightings.  There were 5 lights.  One at the tip, then two down each side, perfectly symmetrical and at a perfect angle.  The lights were very large, circular and the light emitted was diffused, almost as if they were behind a haze.  Remember it was clear enough to see Orion&#8217;s Belt directly across from Manhattan, so it was a crystal clear night.  Other planes that were further away by miles had sharper looking lights and were more visible.   I was glad that I was looking at the stars or I would have never seen it because of how muted it was.  There were NO FAA lights on it whatsoever.  No headlights, no beacon lights, no red lights and definitely nothing flashing.  The lights that were present were a very soft white-yellowish color and did NOT flash. The body looked to follow the contours of the lights although it was hard to make out a solid surface.  It was almost like you could see through the! craft while just making out the signatures of its edges but I couldn&#8217;t see the stars behind it.  There was no sound what so ever.  It seemed to fly at a high speed very effortlessly.  When I had realized what I had seen it took my breath away.  My heart jumped straight up into my throat and I actually had a hard time breathing for a minute and I think I mumbled the &#8220;f&#8221; word to myself a few times.  I am 100% convinced that what I saw, I was not supposed to have seen.  It was very faint, lasted only for a few seconds, and was unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen in the night sky or in my life for that matter.  I&#8217;m not saying that it was extraterrestrial, but if it wasn&#8217;t then it was some sort of top-secret aircraft that hasn&#8217;t been disclosed by the government.  It is something that I will remember for the rest of my life."

While looking for Leonid showers on my porch.  I noticed a dully lit chevron shaped object which at first appeared like a moving constellation of shiny stars moving pretty slow and steady across the sky.  There was very little to almost no noise accompanying it.  It wasn't very noticeable would really have to be paying attention.  I looked up satellites and space station tracking maps and nothing that I could find was in the area.

The object moved sideways very slowly in a Northwest direction.  It seemed to be gliding the way a balloon would glide.  Then all six white lights got very bright (like high-beams on a car)  and a little red light appeared from the south and approached the object.  The red light seemed to 'dock' inside of the bottom white light on the right hand column.  The object went back to low-beams just before the red light docked and it continued in a northwest direction.  Size:  fold a dollar bill in half and hold it at arms length in front of you.   That's how big it appeared to be in the sky.  (very big)  Was about 30 degrees off horizon.  Duration: about 3 to 5 minutes before it disappeared behind the trees.  Only my dog and I were present.  odd note:  wind had been blowing really hard just before it appeared, then wind was calm.   After it left, the wind blew really hard again.   The object made no noise at all."
11/18/2012 21:05,Fireball,1-2 minutes,Roswell, GA,34.01465617,-84.34031652,"Reddish Orange fireballs over Roswell Georgia  My sighting started at approximately 9:05pm EST.  I was on the back porch of my home looking to the north,north east , away from the moon which was approximately 180 degrees the other direction and below the tree line. This is my largest view of the night sky as i am mostly surrounded by very tall trees.  I was sitting facing this direction and noticed 2 bright reddish orange lights emerging over the tree line at 30 degrees off compass north, which is my horizon and the lowest tree line in sight.  The lights appeared about an inch apart from my point of view moving from what appeared to be an East to West bearing.  The lights were bright but not as bright as Jupiter which was off to my right which i see regularly and is often the brightest object in the sky other than the moon.  The sky was completely clear, and i could see stars on the tree line/ horizon in the background, as well as a few passing/blinking planes in the same approximate area as for comparison. I am very familiar with the air traffic around this area and am very familiar with the the flight paths over this area as it seems to be a relatively high traffic area for planes.  However this was nothing like anything i have seen for myself before.  The 2 lights we diverging and disappeared in about 10-15 seconds.  They seemed to be ascending horizontally rather than any sort of decent, as possibly a flare would have, and were moving at a steady rate.   The relation to each other was about 12 o&#8217;clock and 5 o! &#8217;clock top to bottom, as if a plane was on an extremely high banking maneuver, although the lights seemed much too far apart and to quickly moving to be one object.  I quickly determined that these lights were not connected because they seemed to be drifting apart from one another while holding their bearing of East to West while moving at their own independent rates of speed.  When i stood up out of curiosity and took about 3 steps forward, about 10-15 sec later, 3-4 more of the same objects appeared as the 2 before over the same spot heading in the same direction.  My house is situated on a hill and i immediately went up the hill to gain a better perspective and as i did a total of 6-7 lights appeared moving in this similar direction.  I grabbed my iPhone and began recording what i could.  It was completely dark so i didn't know if they would show up or not, but despite the neighbor&#8217;s patio light glaring against the camera i managed to capture s few of the lights.  Unfortunately i stopped recording on accident when i starting moving up the stairs to the top of the hill, so when i got to the top i started another recording.   Although ! you can make out some of the lights in the video it really does no justice to the sighting as i was filming on a phone at night and had a bad glare.  I happen to be a videographer/ video editor and hesitate to post the footage due to its poor quality even though some of the lights are visible in the video it is certainly not a definitive piece of evidence in any way as to what these lights were or really even their bright reddish orange color. Mostly it will serve as documentation to myself that it actually happened.  With in about a minute all of the lights disappeared in front of me, not in any kind of sequence and although they were flying in some sort of formation relative to one another,  there was no recognizable pattern.  These lights were not blinking but had some sort of vague pulsing regularity that never stopped until they disappeared.  There was also no noise whatsoever before the sighting, during or after.  I stayed for about 20 min examining the sky for any further explanation but had no further sightings."
11/18/2012 20:15,Triangle,19:00,College Place, WA,46.04604466,-118.3849956,"Stationary streetlight looking craft/tri-lit orange/green/red UFO hovering through College Place, WA  Walking down the street looking at the sky when I noticed a single star in the sky, slightly resembling a streetlight. It was cloudy out, so it struck me as sort of odd that the one single star shown so brightly. I experienced a psychedelic flashback while staring at the &amp;quot;star&amp;quot; and walking, where I was trapped walking in place(the road beneath me was moving, and a fence I was walking by was still panning past me), and the star seemed to be the only object that was normal within that period, which seemed like eternity.  Terrified, the thought of the star being a UFO and inducing my trip occurred to me and I was able to come out of that state. I'd been observing the star for a good 4 minutes. After, I'd walked past a tree that had blocked my view of the object, and once passed the obstacle, the star was gone.  I looked around the sky a bit and found it slowly hovering to the north of me, the size of an aspirin at arms length, with the orange streetlight glow dimmed and a green and red light added to it in a triangle formation. I watched as it slowly flew over head for a good 01:10-15(minute:second) until it faded into some clouds. I continued looking for it, and noticed it reappear in the distance 2:10 later, half the size, moving at the same speed for about 10 seconds.  Throughout the period of the craft moving, there was a sound similar to an airplane, only it seemed to be coming from the ground. The object was too slow to be an airplane, and had a sort of hazy greenish glowing ring around it."

I was standing outside looking up into the sky when I noticed a very faint object. At first I thought it was just a flock of birds but noticed it was much higher and there was no sound. It was heading south and was barely noticeable.  There were no lights and no sound.  It looked like 7 objects flying in a perfect &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; formation because the objects were faint enought to see but nothing else was visible.
11/18/2012 19:20,Fireball,2 minutes,Russell Springs, KY,37.04976149,-85.07448448,Orange fireball passes directly overhead in southern KY  At approximately 7:15pm on 11/18/12 we observed in the sky a ball of fire moving from the north to the south.  I came almost directly overhead maybe 800 to 1000 feet off the ground.    I first thought it was an airplane on fire as it was moving toward local airport.  As it came overhead you could see that there was no structure on fire but just this huge ball of fire moving silently through the sky.    As it went on to the south it appeared to veer to the right moving westward and continued until it went out of sight over the horizon.    This thing cast an immense glow and you could see the flames jumping and flickering.  You would expect to hear something as you would with any other craft passing overhead but it was silent.    My ex-wife who is an RN witnessed this also.  She spotted it first.  I am a college graduate and am mostly skeptical of any UFO reports.    This was truly unexplainable.

It then was a lot bigger with a round shape but as it started going off in the distance looked like it changed shape.  Later that night we had seen a large object that appeared like it was touching down with large red flashing lights.

We looked to the east and a few miles away we seen fireballs hovering, lining up in formations (triangles, straight lines), changing shape, and moving. We watched more and more appear out of nowhere.  A bright light would start to form into something bigger and bigger, red and orangish.  It would stand still then slowly move to the east. Every object basically did the same thing, line up, hover, and then proceed to the east, one after another.  They would move east, we lost them behind trees, and then just fade away into the sky as if they were planes in a distance with no navigation lights.  Every move they made seemed to be for a reason. After about 20 minutes of watching we decided to call the local Police.    An officer pulled up to us and watched for about 10 minutes and made comments such as, &quot;That's weird,&quot; and &quot;Maybe were under attack.&quot;  The officer pulled off in hopes of getting closer to the objec! ts.  We watched for another 20 minutes before the last one just sat there. We left in frusteration because we knew we would never find the real truth.

Then smaller lights started appearing out of no where, and within 5 minutes went for smaller orange/red lights into these large lights hovering and would slowly move then stop and hover some more all while turning brighter and brighter and larger, almost like they were going to burst.  After getting extremely bright and large they would then get smaller and smaller and eventually turn into small plane lighting objects and fly northeast.  There were as many as 4-6 in the sky as once and when they changed and flew away more would come out of nowhere and repeat the cycle.    We're very active sky watchers and this was something we've never seen before so we called a non emergency number in Worth IL, and reported the sight to have possibly have someone else come and see them.  A police officer was able to come by, he didn't get out of the car but said he noticed them as he was turning into the lot we were in. His first thought was Chinese lanterns, however, I've seen lanterns before but there was no way they were lanterns because of the distance they were incomparions to the brightness, as well as the way they were flying, stopping and changing shape.  He finally just said he doesn't know then, and said it was weird, and that he was going to drive closer to the area.  After about 50 mins no more appearing and we left.  They made no sound, and the strangest part was how they turned into what one might think are airplanes in the sky after being so larger and bright, almost like fireballs in the sky, but turning into planes and flying away, and the only! reason I keep saying plane like object is because of the way ! they loo ked like when they got small and flew away, they had a small red blinking light like planes do with a constant small white light."

Shortly after I stepped outside, I observed several (approximately 5 or 6) orange or red round objects in the sky to the north of our apartment.  For purposes of orientation, I can say that the objects were visible north of the intersection of Allen Rd. and Willow Knolls Rd. over that area&#8217;s car dealerships (Lexus, Toyota, Nissan).  The objects were in some sort of pattern, possibly a diamond shape.  At first I thought the pattern looked like a fireworks display of some sort, but I heard no explosions.  In fact, I did not hear any noise at all coming from the area.  I pointed the objects out to my wife and she began trying to take photos and video with my cellular phone.  Unfortunately, upon review of the video, the objects were not visible.  We also saw a male exit a vehicle up the road (unknown how many passengers we! re in the car) from our apartment to look at the objects, but we did not speak to each other.  As we continued to observe the objects in the sky, we noticed that some of the objects would suddenly fade away.  However, we also saw new orange/red round objects rising up from the ground in the same area north of our apartment.  While they were ascending, I noticed that the objects hovered in a manner that was somewhat similar to helicopters. But, I have never seen helicopters move quite like this and I can&#8217;t imagine why helicopters would be forming patterns in the sky at night.

The four lights seemed to launch from below and join the moving x, then all the lights that were forming the curved x disappeared. After that, only three were left that just moved upward north and vanished into the sky.  This beautiful occurrence lasted only 5 min."

I had just arrived home in Aurora, IL with my wife, mother-in-law and two girls right about 8:30 pm. It was already dark outside being that it was mid-November. We had groceries in the car that we had to unload them before my wife was to take her mother home in Naperville, IL.  So we all got out of the car, the girls went inside followed by the rest of us carrying the groceries. I came back outside by myself to get the rest of the groceries. As I walked down to the car that was parked in the middle of the driveway, I noticed an orange ball of light with blurry edges come to view on my left moving south to north in a perfectly straight line. It was moving at a pretty good speed and awfully low which is why I stayed fixated on it!  All of a sudden, a second identical ball of light showed up right behind it! By then, the first ball of light was right in front of me, but disappeared behind my neighbor&#8217;s house that was also in front of me. I then turned by attention to the 2nd ball of light that was following the first and I watched it as it began to move in front of me&#8230;.Just as I stayed transfixed on it, I noticed yet another ball of light pop up behind it that looked just like the first two and chasing the second ball of light. It was then that I knew that these were not planes! All I can say was that they were bright orange balls of light chasing one another. I then instantly realized that these were not planes! Planes simply do not behave like this; they do not chase each other in this manner or fly so low.   I then ran into the house through the garage and I frantically told my wife, who was in the kitchen, to come with me and to make it fast because I had to show her something before they disappeared. She was actually pretty startled by my sense of excitement. She came running out and I pointed out the two lights. By then, the 2nd ball of light had just began to peek out again from being out of view due to my neighbor&#8217;s house all while the 3rd ball of light was just about to be covered by my neighbor&#8217;s house.   Suddenly, we both then noticed that an identical 4th ball of light appeared flying in the same manner, path and height as the other 3 balls of lights that preceded it. All 4 objects looked identical, flew in the same speed and height all while following each other and were very low. They were so low that they should have made some noise, but they were perfectly silent. They made no sound whatsoever. They all appeared to by flying along US-30 which would put them over in Oswego, IL air space which is the direction I was facing. As all of the objects peeked out from behind my neighbor&#8217;s home, they changed their direction all heading west towards Oswego at which time they simply disappeared in the distance.   My wife and I were left dumbfounded by what we just witnessed. After the last light disappeared, we simply got the rest of the groceries and came back into the house. I was left intrigued by the whole experience and I began to look over the internet for any mentions of the same from other people in the area. Though I did not find any mentions of today&#8217;s sightings from other area people, I did stumble upon several internet sites, including this site, referencing similar/recent sightings of the same orange lights in Oswego, IL."

They were traveling too slow to be a plane, too fast to be a blimp , and there was virtually no noise to them.   On the little bit of video I captured ( I ran into the house for my phone when I realized I might be seeing a UFO ), you can hear a regular plane flying over our heads about a mile away. These orbs came over the treeline, maybe 300 feet over our heads and travelled close in proximity and in unisone.

I looked to where she was pointing and at a glance what I saw did appear to be stars of constellations.  As I continued to look at these lights I noticed that they appeared to be moving.  The lights were not maintaining the pattern they were in when I first looked at them.  They also seemed to be much closer in distance than what most stars look like.  I looked around in different directions and noticed that there were not any actual stars out yet.  These lights were the only lights in the sky.

11/17/2012 18:10,Fireball,15 minutes,Hampton Borough, NJ,40.705132,-74.96636651,"Bright, glowing reddish-orange fireballs in the evening sky.  On Saturday night, November 17, 2012, between 6:10 &#8211; 6:25pm (EST) my wife and I saw about 20 large, bright, glowing reddish-orange spheres (or &#8220;fireballs&#8221;) in the evening sky, over a period of approx. 15 minutes from our front porch in Hampton Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  The sky was perfectly clear, with low humidity (the Dew Point was about 25 degrees F) and the temperature was 38 degrees F.  There was a bright, waxing crescent moon to the southwest.  When I initially stepped out onto my front porch, to let my dogs out, I noticed two pairs of large, very bright reddish-orange glowing lights that were roughly spherical and could be described as &#8220;fireballs&#8221; that seemed to &#8220;float&#8221; in the sky, although they were clearly moving slowly in a straight line from the east-southeast to the northwest.  As the first pair got closer, they appeared to get a little bigger, until they were about double their initial size.  As they got directly overhead, they appeared to gradually fade, until they eventually disappeared, somewhat like a light dimmer.  Over the next 15 minutes, my wife and I saw another 15, or so, identical &#8220;fireballs&#8221; rise over the treetops of the mountain to our east-southeast, always travelling in pairs, in groups approximately 30 to 60 seconds apart, and always emanating from the same spot on the eastern horizon.  They all travelled in the same straight line, toward the northwest, seeming to &#8220;float&#8221; in the sky, but! making slow progress to a position directly overhead in a leisurely span of time of about 45 seconds to 1 minute, before they all gradually faded away over a span of about 10 seconds.  Since the mountain is about 1 mile from our house, and it took the &#8220;fireballs&#8221; about 1 minute to get directly overhead, I would estimate they were travelling at about 60 miles per hour.  They seemed to be fairly low in the sky, and I would estimate their altitude to be about 2,500 to 3,000 feet above us.  Their reddish-orange glow was constant &#8211; that is to say they did not &#8220;blink&#8221; like the lights on a plane or helicopter. There was no tail or flames &#8211; just a steady glow.  The way they seemed to &#8220;float&#8221;, or &#8220;hover&#8221;, seemed somewhat like a helicopter, and the way they arose over the horizon, always in pairs and seemly in a type of intentional formation, seemed to both my wife and I reminiscent of the helicopter scene in the movie &#8220;Apocalypse Now&#8221;. These &amp;quot;fireballs&amp;quot; made no sound.  About 5 minutes from my initial sighting, I decided to call 911, to find out if other people in our area had noticed and reported these mysterious glowing lights.  The 911 operator said no one else had called, and suggested they might be a meteor shower (which they were not; meteors move much faster, are much smaller and burn white hot, not glowing reddish-orange, like a fireplace ember).  She connected me with the New Jersey State Police Barracks, who dispatched a Trooper to our house.  By the time the Trooper arrived (about 15 minutes later, around 6:35 pm), the glowing lights has vanished.  He was very nice, but said no one else had reported seeing the lights.  My wife and I would be very much interested in knowing if anybody else reported seeing these glowing lights on the evening of Nov. 17th &#8211; they were the most unusual things either of us have ever seen and we would like to know an explanation for them.

The object then seemed to skip almost as it gained speed and turned north gaining altitude and continuing north for about a foot in the sky. It then made a long smooth curve like maneuver towards north east and then east following the horizon and up behind cloud coverage and out.  At the moment I saw what I thought was a satellite I pointed it out to my girlfriend and she confirmed that she saw it also as it began to speed up. We then both watched in amazement and it took off. We both saw a obviously red circle that seemed to be able to control speed, altitude, and direction. She mentioned that she thought it might have had a cloudy faded orb surrounding it also. The object seemed to be going faster than anything we have ever seen before while following a very strange smooth flight plan. No other lights were visible on it and the sky was brightly lit, it was almost spooky how bright the sky was. We also recognized 7 meteors that entered the atmosphere and disappeared just like they always do. We are confused and excited about what we saw and are wondering if this is normal or has anyone else experienced this."

It was foggy but there was a crystal clear sky above.  Lots of stars visible.  But also, above the eastern horizon, above the tree line (25-45 degrees above the horizon I&#8217;d guess) was three bright orange/gold lights, like fireballs perhaps or like the golden glow of  burning bits from a firework that fall to the ground at the 4th of July.  They were, of course, in a triangle formation being three of them but they were configured in a way that appeared as if they were attached to a monstrous jet plane.  The lights were brighter than any star in the sky and bigger too.  It did not appear to be moving much at first but looked as if it were perhaps coming at us.  My husband joined me at the window to see.  It turned,  all three lights in formation, to the north as if it were a jet banking to land and began to head in that direction.  I ran outside to see if I could hear anything but t! here was no sound and by the time I got out there it was fading and I watched the last light trail off to the north until it disappeared/burned out.  There was no noticeable flickering, barely a wavering of the light but it faded to a darker gold/brown before disappearing completely as a coal extinguishing slowly.  All of the movement was very slow, no sharp turns or sudden acceleration.  We thought first of the leonid meteor shower and hoped it was related but neither of us had seen any meteor behave in such a way."

At one point, they stopped in the same spot in the sky (we actually have an airplane beacon behind our house out in the field).  They all eventually went in different directions in the sky.   There were airplanes in the sky in the distance and at one point, it looked like the plane and object came very close.

Then I noticed that it was moving all over the sky, right, left, up, down. I ran inside to get a blanket, and ran back out and it was still there. It would get closer at times, and it would occasionally stop and hover. I could see that it could be a spear shape, with the light in the center and coming from the center there were long lines, as if connecting on the outer rim. I wasn't sure what I was seeing, and kept watching it for an hour, going around the sky, getting closer then further away. When I did get to see it, it looked like some sort of craft, honestly.

I then noticed 3 other lights around it, which were not as bright, but moving all over in all directions around the brighter one. I ran inside to grab my co-worker (who absolutely does not believe in UFOs by the way) to show her and I said to her &amp;quot;you need to see this and tell me I'm not crazy!&amp;quot; She walked outside and looked up and watched for about ten seconds, then ran back inside and said she couldn't watch because it was freaking her out- I stayed outside and she kept yelling at me to come inside but I couldn't stop staring up at these crazy moving light! s for about ten minutes.

The one on the top was slightly to the right in relation to the one on the bottom. They looked bright and big (size of Jupiter or slightly bigger) with a deep color of orange/red.  As they began to move from left to right slowly, I tried to get a better view through the branches of the trees in my yard which were partially blocking the view. I was curious to find out if they were planets but once they began to move I thought it could be a plane. But then, 2 planes one on top of the other didn&#8217;t make much of a sense to me. So I called my husband to come outside and look at these lights. He came out and looked but was too concern on stepping on dog poop outside. It is cold tonight in the 40&#8217;s. So he came inside and didn&#8217;t want to bother being cold. I was still curious to find out what it was as the 2 lights continued to move from left to right. All of a sudden I see then 3 lights. If I were to connect the dots they would form a triangle in the sky about 4 inches apart from each dot. The color of the dots were exactly the same color as the other 2 lights. As this happened, I ran inside to call a friend of mine so she could go out and look at the west sky ! to see if she could see the same lights. The 3 lights began to move from left to right and instead of 3 dots I could only see 2 kind of horizontal lights from each other moving again from right to left (west to southwest). It seemed like the lights would move and stop.  The one far left kept going while the one on the right stopped and dimmed to no light at all.  I moved my position down the driveway toward the south so I could keep an unobstructed view of these 2 objects.  The light on the right continues to move slowly and more dimmed but I still could see it. All of a sudden the light that had dimmed before came back on with a white brightness just like a flood light shinning down and immediately dimmed to no light again.  It seemed like this light had appeared for 2 seconds disappearing again completely.  It was very cold and since I had no jacket, I just noticed the light from the left continue to move southwest and getting dimmer and dimmer.  After I called the center to re! port this sighting, I went up to my husband&#8217;s room to ask if h! e did or did not see any light.  He told me all he saw was one red light."

I then noticed ahead of us and slightly to the right of the highway a particularly bright object in the sky. Though, as I stated, many stars were visible, at a certain point they became drowned out by the lights of civilization. The object that I saw was well below this line. It was also significantly brighter and larger than any of the stars I could see.  While still staring curiously at the object, I asked my husband, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; and pointed to it. He responded that he had noticed it as well and was wondering the same thing. Upon more focused observation, I could discern that it was triangular in shape, and had red lights surrounding its yellow-orange center.  It seemed to be in a fixed position hovering over the earth, but as we drove towards its general direction, we seemed to be getting closer to it.  I watched it for about 10 more minutes from the car window, and it continued to stay in the same place. We parked in a parking lot to watch it without the car moving. Then suddenly it seemed to jump back into space slightly. I saw the movement and then noticed that it was smaller and dimmer, as if it had retreated. From then on it continued to stay in its new position, hovering without movement. I took several photos with my cellphone camera, and though not the greatest quality, in one of them you can clearly see its shape and the red lights around the center.

The backyard is about a half acre deep to a fence line which adjoins to a cow pasture.   It is about 50 - 75 feet before the tree line begins in the cow pasture.  Not a bird as it had no wings and was utterly silent.  It did not lose any altitude and was so dimly lit that it disappeared as soon as it passed over.  It seemed to have a very fine, thin trail at least 25+ ft that also dissolved into thin air.  Very eerie experience. I have never seen anything that substantial in size fly in such a straight pattern so quietly in the dark."

It was very big triangle shaped, as it lowered it seemed to be slowly rotating, so we saw the underside of it. It was grey, metallic looking almost liquid.  The light configuration was strange, there were several very bright lights that seemed to run along the bottom with brighter bigger lights on the corners of the bottom of the craft.

On the evening of November 14th I was driving home from in the western suburbs of Knoxville, Tennessee on Westland Drive.  I was headed east when I noticed what appeared to be a very low flying airplane in the distance.  There is McGhee Tyson airport about 8 miles to the southwest, so I didn't, at that moment, think it was out of the ordinary, except for the altitude it was at.  For the next 45 seconds I had a clear view of this craft. I kept waiting for it to pull away and gain altitude, but as I got closer, I realized that I was gaining on it.  I slowed down as I got closer and realized that it was hovering about what appeared to be 400 feet above the road.  It had two white lights on either side of what I first thought were the wings, with a red light blinking in the center.  As I got closer and closer, now only going maybe 20 miles an hour I had a totally clear view of this craft.  As I drove under it, only then was I able to see that it had an oval or rounded shape to the underside of it.  I really wanted to pull over, get out and observe this craft, but I was just a little freaked by the whole experience.  As I drove away I kept looking in my rear view mirror, but never saw the lights or craft again.  I would really like to think that it was a plane or helicopter, as it was hovering, but I know of no plane that can do that and I've seen too many 'copters and it made no noise that I could hear.

I opened the back door to smoke a cigarette before going to bed and noticed a large bright set of white lights with red and green lights hovering beyond a tree break about a half mile from the house. This sparked my attention because I saw the same bright lights around the same day of the week and time of night last week.  I watched it hover for a long time and thought it could have been a helicopter because of how it was hovering and how low it was.  I stepped outside to see if I could hear it because if it was a helicopter, you would have definitely been able to hear it because it was so close.  I can make the helicopter sound comparison because of an aerial search conducted recently for an escaped convict from a local prison in which helicopters were used to search in our area.  The aircraft didn&#8217;t sound anything like the helicopter I heard several weeks ago and as a matter of fact, didn&#8217;t have a sound at all until it was flying overhead.  After several minutes, the aircraft began slowly moving closer and eventually flew directly over our house and was so low I could see it was a triangle shaped aircraft with lots of bright white lights and a green and red light.  If the aircraft had been a plane, you would have definitely been able to hear it as it was so low and so close but I couldn&#8217;t hear anything but what sounded like a plane that was flying at a high altitude, miles and miles above.  Once it flew over, I didn&#8217;t see anything else but will be looking from now on for sure.  I am a middle class working mother of one who works in a physician&#8217;s office and is educated.

I am a frequent flyer between here and the U.K  I know what planes look like at night time from the ground and in the air, I have seen many helicopters in the sky, this was neither of them.  I went onto the internet and searched what I had seen and to my surprise there are many similar sightings thank god, because for a minute there I started to doubt myself, but to deny myself what I had seen would just be a lie.   I know what I witnessed on 11/14/2012 at 5 am and I feel very privileged, even if my friends and family don&#8217;t believe me, I do not care.

Afterwards I immediately checked the real-time ISS position but it was over Europe so it was not that, also it does not follow a direct straight west to east direction.

It was Orange in color and was very bright, we were in awe of its size and brightness.  As we were looking and trying to determine what it was it started to move very slowly and take a triangle shape with twinkling lights on each point of the triangle, the lights were almost pulsating.  The craft kept moving in a very slow, linear path that looked like it was coming directly towards us.  It passed just to our right and was only 1,500-2,000 feet in the air, as it came closer we quickly determined it wasn't any airplane or helicopter because it made no sound.  When the craft passed us we noticed 3 more with identicle shapes appear, they were also moving slowly and had the same linear path just spaced further apart.  As we watched the other crafts as they moved closer we noticed one craft that was almost directly infront of us drop a small, light-like object to the ground.  My friend and I were already kinda freaked out about seeing these objects and became almost scared when we saw one drop something to the ground.  These crafts continued their straight, slow paths and when they passed they just sorta disappeared.  We drive for another 5-10 minutes before arriving at our destination, when we arrived we continued to look in the eastern sky where these crafts were coming from and ended up seeing three more that went right over our heads.  We got very good looks at the ones that went right over our heads, they were definitely large black triangles with lights on each point and a few lights in the middle and along the edges.  They were moving very slow and had no sound until they were just past us, then we heard a very light propulsion-like engine sound.  All of these objects basically just appeared and were all uniform in size, shape, and color, but their lights differed in slight color and patterns of the pulsations.  My friend and I are just a couple regular, football loving, family guys and neither one of us have ever seen anything that compares to what we saw this night.  After seeing these objects we tried to come up with logical explanations as to what these things were and we came up with nothing.

As it moved it passed in front of some stars.  It didn't block them out but they were not clearly visible either.

The light seemed to be about 500 feet away from our house, located behind my neighbor&#8217;s house.  They both immediately called my father and me. My dad was on the phone so I went to go look at the light from my brother&#8217;s bedroom window.  The light seemed to be stationary at first; however it slowly started moving to the north.  We called my father and he watched it with us for roughly two to three minutes.  The light again started moving a little further north for another minute.  Then it began to rise rather quickly. It seemed to be about 60 to 80 feet in the air.  Then it seemed that the light started to get bigger; however it began moving to the west, towards us.  It traveled extremely fast, crossing about 500 feet in a matter of 10 seconds.  As it traveled it produced an extremely loud humming sound.  As it approached our location the bright light seemed to die out! . It crossed in between mine and my neighbor&#8217;s house, so to get a better look I ran to the other bedroom down the hallway.  Once I got to the window I looked and seen that it was some sort of aircraft.  The aircraft seemed to be like a cross, with a triangular front.  It seemed to be about 30 feet long, and 15 feet wide.  The sides of the aircraft seemed to be very straight with a point at the end.  It had two antenna-like lights coming off the front end of it and another antenna-like light at the tail end of it.  The antennas were about 7 feet long with a diamond shape light at the end and the lights all a very bright red. At the front of the aircraft, there seemed to be some sort of headlights.  They were dim, but I was still able to notice them quite easily.  There were no lights on the sides of the craft. As the aircraft passed, the bright light it emitted turned on again.  It seemed to be almost like some sort of searchlight and was located behind the headlights.  As the aircraf! t kept traveling west, it just vanished. Almost like a quick f! ade out.  I do understand that it is a possibility that it could have been airplane of some sort, however there are a few airports only several miles away from where I live so I see many planes flying by all the time and never experienced any behaving in this fashion with such a bright light or moving with so much noise.   UPDATE: at 12:35 am ET, I heard the loud humming noise once again except I wasn&#8217;t able to locate the aircraft or where the sound was coming from. The noise lasted for about 35 seconds and seemed to be moving from north to south.   My brother took several photos of the aircraft and a video; however, it&#8217;s a small dot in the pictures and video. Although, you can see how bright the light is compared to the light my neighbor has on the side of his house.    P.S., the gentleman who answered the phone when I called was extremely rude."

The lights appeared near the surface of the bay and looked to be slightly vibrating. However, there was no noise associated with the lights.  The formation of lights behaved analogously to a flock of birds in the sky.  Initially the formation was extremely tightly packed together near the ocean's surface.  The lights moved very fluently and had floating like motions in which the lights had the ability to move smoothly in all directions(up, down, right, left, etc.).    The lights began to spread out in a purposeful way with a triangular formation of three lights in the center (near the rear of fleet) remaining close together in that small triangle shape.

Object seen on Saturday, November 10, 2012 at approximately 11:45 pm.  My wife and I had just returned from watching a football game locally.  We pulled up in front of our house. (suburban neighborhood) and I noticed very bright lights to the south.  Since we have a small airport here in town (behind me and on the other side of a freeway to my east) I assumed it was a low flying airplane making an approach to land. I walked my wife to the door and turned to look at the lights again.  I realized that there were no red and green lights as required and the lights seemed brighter than a small plane. So I assumed maybe it was a commercial airliner making its approach into Eugenes regional airport to my northwest.  The craft appeared to stop its forward motion.  I ran inside to grab a pair of binoculars.  When I came out and looked at the object, it almost appeared that instead of what I thought were lights, almost looked like it was on fire.  Flickering but I saw no smoke or vapor trail.  (Maybe the atmosphere causing the lights to appear to be flickering) It was then I realized that the object was not an altitude for a plane making an approach locally, but at what I would estimate to be at least 30,000 feet.  I have observed jetliners flying over my town at high altitudes with my binoculars, high enough to produce a vapor trail.  And I could see that it was a plane with wings and lights etc&#8230;so I felt confident estimating the objects altitude.  The lights all of a sudden went dark. I pulled the binoculars down straining to catch a glimpse of the craft with the naked eye.  And that&#8217;s when I saw a faint, gray object, traveling about the speed of a satellite orbiting earth.  I found it with my binoculars again.  It was at a very high altitude, no lights, no smoke or vapor trail.  Grey, round, not like a ball but like a disk from my vantage point.  I followed the object in my binoculars for at least another minute or two as it headed north, and finally disappeared behind some clouds and my roofline.  I called a local news station the next day to ask if anyone else had reported strange lights, but no one had.  I talked to my dad the next morning. He is retired from Boeing and once held his pilots license. I asked him if what I saw could have been a weather balloon, but he said they don&#8217;t have lights (especially that bright) and wouldn&#8217;t have been traveling at the rate of speed.

The craft was triangle shaped and painted in standard navy gloss grey top with creamey white belly. It was absolutely cleane no dirt streaks or oil on it.  What appeared to be a weapons bay was open and ran most of the full length of the craft.  There was no cockpit so was a remotely steered craft.  No markings of any kind could be seen but the weapons bay was lit up and you could see ribbing? and tubes for electrical or hydraulics inside.  The amazing thing was it's speed it was moving about the speed of a man fast walking.  A standard airfoil would not keep this craft up. Since it was running flat at very low speed the only thing floating it was probably a single gas jet generator pruducing some form of ionized, capacitive lift.  It was about the size of a large single engine private plane up to a private twin.the tail terminated in what appeared to be flaps that were set neutral   and again gave no assist in lift. most likely this is deriviant of the Bifield Brown lifting concept. It continued on in a wright Pat direction.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))"

It was located to the west of my position.  I told my wife to come out and witness the movement.  There were no sounds that we could hear of. The lead circle would pulsate slightly and then die off.  Because it was dark, we weren&#8217;t sure if it blacked out or was masked by clouds.  About 10 seconds after, the second blacked out.  My wife went back into the house and I continued to walk the dog around the neighborhood.  Approximately 3 minutes later, I saw a third red/orange circle trailing the same route as the first two.  After about 1 to 2 minutes, the third blacked out as well.  I saw regular aircraft in the vicinity of these circles.  It was obvious that these red circles did not fit the profile of a normal aircraft.  Additionally, the movement was unnatural to a regular aircraft. It would shif! t mid-air.  When I got back into the house, my wife researched this to see if anyone else saw this pattern.  On the UFO Reporting Center, the description matched similar reports.

UFO Report  Location: 3 miles east of Castle Rock, WA, approximately 1/4 mile from SR504 and 1000&#8217; east of Si Town Road.  Date and Time: November 10th, 2012, 18:28 Pacific Standard Time.  Sky Condition:  No Ceiling, Clear Sky, Dark  Period of time observed:  From initial visual acquisition to their departure, approximately 1 minute.  Description of Objects:  Three totally silent, solid, reddish orange glowing spheres forming an equilateral triangle.  Size: Each sphere approximately  the size of a dime held out at arm&#8217;s length.  Event Description: At approximately 18:28 Pacific Standard Time on November 10th, 2012, I was driving Southbound on Si Town Road toward my home.  Three bright reddish orange spheres low to the ground initially caught my eye when I was approximately 1200 feet south of SR504 on Si Town Rd.  Seconds after my initial visual acquisition these objects were momentarily obscured by trees.  When I re-acquired these objects about two seconds later I now had an unobstructed view of them.  They appeared to be hovering at this point at an altitude of 500 feet or perhaps less above ground level and about 1000 feet horizontally to the southeast of my location.  The ground level at this location is about 700 feet above sea level.  The three objects were close enough to my car that I almost stopped my car as I actually feared that they might block the road, but they stayed hovering where they had been the whole time so I continued southbound on Si Town Rd.  They were totally silent.  They did not blink, rotate or change color.  They maintained a constant luminosity until the end of this event.  They were each very bright and each sphere was about as big around as a dime held at arm&#8217;s length.  At this point I was not sure if I was observing one solid triangular craft with lights at each corner, or if I was observing three independent objects.  As I turned east onto Ness Rd. and approached my house about 45 seconds after initially acquiring these objects they began to maneuver independently of each other, but still over the same location.  At this point they maneuvered into a straight line, equally spaced from each other and began to ascend.  I quickly pulled into my driveway with the car facing basically toward the objects.  At this point they all ascended vertically together with no horizontal travel noted.  One by one each object faded out and disappeared up into the darkness.  At this point I was quite shaken. I ran out of my car and into the house to get my wife.  I grabbed my camera and tried to explain what had just happened to my wife, but there was no longer anything to see.  I called the Cowlitz County Sheriff&#8217;s Office and Castle Rock City Police Department 15 to 20 minutes after this event to inquire if anyone else had seen what I saw.  They both responded in the negative.  Let me add that until retiring I was a commercial pilot and I still hold an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate. I&#8217;ve been flying since 1977.   As such I am quite used to identifying and looking at things in the sky.  The objects I observed tonight were NOT aircraft navigation lights, emergency lights, landing lights, helicopters, lighter-than-air craft, weather balloons, flares, Chinese lanterns, meteorological phenomena, satellites, swamp gas, or any other nonsense.  I know how non-aviation people can often misidentify things they see in the sky.  This was not the case tonight.  These were real, solid objects and appeared to maneuver under intelligent control.    I&#8217;m still shaking from what I saw more than an hour and a half ago.   ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness on several occasions, and we have exchanged several e-mail messages with him"

I kept watching as as it continues to flash about once every 5 seconds or so, I decided to go downstairs and look from outside and noticed that this flash did not move.  I used to work in the navy and I know what aircraft look like at night and I knew it was not an aircraft.  I thought it might be something else but I have no idea what.  I tried to record on my iPhone but it does not show anything.  Perhaps it could be professionally edited to show this pulsing or flashing light.    After a minute of watching from outside it seemed to become more faint and moved away from me into space.

I got out of bed and went to my bedroom window overlooking the Port of Grays Harbor area in Hoquiam, WA.  I didn&#8217;t see anything but did take notice that there wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky.  I went to the spare bedroom that faces west. There I stood for about 3 minutes looking out for a thunderstorm when another giant flash of light lit up the sky again. This time I could see the brightest area to be west of Ocean Shores, WA, so far out that you could tell the source came from far beyond the horizon.  The flash was so bright it made it like daylight for a second. I continued standing there wondering if this might me lightning from way off the coast. Just like the time lapse between the first two flashes, after another four minutes, there was another flash, just as bright, coming from the exact location, making me think lightning might be the source.  I did notice that it was so bright, I could see the horizon clearly and there were absolutely no thunderstorm tops to be seen out there. I have lived on the coast and seen lightning offshore but the tops of thunderheads are usually visible during lighting and never ever anything this bright.    I contacted a local news station in Seattle and asked them if they could look at the radar records and determine if thunderstorms were off the coast that early morning but they are not responding of checking this out. I am very sure that if anyone had a security camera&#8217;s recording that they would have detected these three brilliant flashes.

There was solid cloud cover, and it was raining, as it had been for hours.  Then I saw what I first thought was a star, and figured for a second that there was a break in the clouds.  I quickly realized the light that looked like a star was moving at a steady, fairly brisk speed, heading south to north.  I first thought it must be an airliner, as it seemed high enough and fast enough that it couldn&#8217;t be a small plane.  It was only a steady white light, looking much like a star.  If it were a plane, I thought it would have the typical flashing lights; this did not.  Then I thought it may be a satellite, but I thought a satellite would be at a much higher altitude, above the cloud cover. Then the object just stopped and stayed stationary.  It didn&#8217;t take time to slow,  it was moving then it stopped suddenly.    I watched it for about 5 more minutes before getting in out of the rain and heading home.  For the entire time I watched the light, it was clearly visible.  I was not up into the cloud cover at all.

Hello, I made an observation yesterday that I wonder if anyone can help me to identify.  I am in Alaska; I drove up a logging road to find a place where I could do some Astrophotography.  I chose a spot where there was very little light pollution and a low tree line and favorable foreground scene.  After setting up my tripod and camera I chose my composition of the Milky Way galaxy flowing across the sky and into the planet Venus which was bright in the Western Sky.  With my camera positioned in this direction I began taking my series of shots, five sets of 25 second exposure.  While waiting for my intervolometer to cycle through the series of shots I began to look around for a different perspective to shoot next.  This is when I made the sighting.  The sighting was four lights spread apart like the corners of a box, each light exactly the same distance from each other as you travel clockwise around the box.  I used my fist extended at arm&#8217;s reach to measure them and my fist fit perfectly between each of the pairs of stars horizontally and vertically.  What initially caught my eye was that each light was like the beacon of a light house revolving around in a beam.  I could see the beam revolve growing longer as it approached the point of direct opposition from its center to my right then shrinking as it came to the position when it was nearly pointing directly towards me then again growing as it continued to rotate to its right angle on my left and again shrinking until it was a pin point as the light was pointing directly away from me.  Also it was brightest (like a flash) when directly point at me.  Now this alone would be odd but add in the fact that as each light beginning in the top right corner made a complete cycle it would go dark and the next in a clockwise direction would begin a cycle commencing at the same point the previous light has stopped.  So you have four lights acting like lighthouse beacons rotating in turn, clockwise in a square formation.  Additionally I observed them for two hours while I continued to take series of photos for my astrophotography practice; while the stars changed position relative to me, due to the revolving of the Earth these four beacons remained geostationary and in the exact formation the entire time.  And yes I did take multiple photos of these lights I do not have a video and all the shots just show points of light not the beacons my human eyes observed.  Any Idea what I saw, possibly satellites, space station or what?   The time was between 10 and 12pm Alaska Standard Time on November 9th, 2012."

It was flying at a higher altitude than the usual air traffic and it was flying pretty fast.    As it passed overhead it started flying faster and turned upward and disappeared from view.  My sister and I were both wondering what it was since it did not look like anything that we had ever seen flying in the sky.  We came out of the country club a little over an hour later.  I again looked up at the sky and noticed that clouds had moved in.    As I looked toward the Northeast I noticed a round orange sphere (again!!) going toward the Southwest.  This time it was flying lower than the previous one that we had seen.  As it was coming towards us another orange sphere came up behind it.  It was probably a few miles behind it but it was following the same trajectory path as the one in front of it.    Both spheres flew into the clouds and disappeared from our view.

The object, which appeared red to the best of my ability of sight, moved backwards, foward, sideways, then in a zig zag pattern.  Due to recent numerous similar events, I was convinced the object was far from any flight capable object I had ever seen.  When the object changed course west, it stopped near a star and the star began glowing brighter as did the flying object.  The object flew east at incredible speed, immediatly stopped, and flew upwards towards space in a similar fashion as a rocket ship, directly upwards.  As it was on its path towards space , the clouds behind it became thicker and formed behind the object, covering any way to continue viewing it.  Throughout it's flight patterns, it consistently flew behind clouds near the shining star.  I highly stress to inform this is not the first time I have seen an object mane! uver such bizarre flight patterns and shoot directly into space, seeming to somehow each time influence cloud patterns.

The lights appeared not to be reflections, but emanating from whatever the craft was itself.  They looked perhaps like the fire one would see from a jet propulsion engine, but they were vertical rectangular/cylindrical in shape.  No trail, as one would see with a con-trail from an airplane, was left.    The two witnesses thought perhaps it was the international space station, although it looked to be too large and too close to be so.    It drifted slowly from the West/Northwestern sky to the Northern sky as its distance became greater.

I don't know what I seen but I got shivers and was totally freaked out.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))

I was the only person that I know that observed it because I was walking my dogs, my dogs acted as if they were scared because they all came in within a minute of the sighting which is unusual for them.

The light had a trajectory similar to a meteor burning up in the atmosphere, but was a distinctly neon green color and was substantially larger.    My first thought was some sort of firework that ignited late, but its speed was also similar to something crashing to Earth.    The direction of travel was from East to West and looked to intersect my southbound direction of travel.  I, however, saw no signs after the flash indicating what happened.    The shape of the light I would describe as similar to the booster rocket assemblies used for Discovery and other spacecraft, except traveling in reverse.

Over the past few weeks, I have noticed some interesting activity. I was outside at work a few weeks back on our nightly break, when I saw a big green flash behind the clouds. It was very large in the sky. I was so shocked, I could barely express what I had seen.  That seemed to be the most significant thing to me, but I didn't feel like it was worth writing about until the last few nights.  On my way home from work, I drive down a strip of road with fields on both sides. Being fall time, they're really empty and easy to see across.  For the past few nights, I've noticed 2 bright orange balls of light on both the north and south horizons.  Very far out, but still noticeable from my car. The first night I thought they were interesting, and then I saw the same thing the second night.  The first night was very cloudy - couldn't see a star in the sky. I could however see these orange balls.  They weren't flashing or moving, just staying very still on the horizons.  Last night was exceptionally clear, and they were clearly visible in the same spots.  They are definitely a whole lot brighter than the rest of the things I could identify in the sky (stars, planes, etc).  On a possibly related note, I've noted a significant increase in the static electricity around here. I got shocked a whole bunch of times last night from doorknobs, in the same place I work every night. I know the time of year probably has something to do with it.  When I woke up this morning, 2 lightbulbs (maybe more?) in my house were dead.  The incandescent kind. Both are bulbs that get a LOT of use in the house, and could have coincidentally died at the same time. I just thought it was interesting.  As far as my (the observer) background goes...not much. I certainly am interested in UFO sightings, but have only ever seen a few times something I couldn't explain.  These few phenomenon in the past weeks have me puzzled, so I figured I'd say something - maybe other people have seen it too! :]   Thanks."

At approximately 9:40 p.m. 11/8/2012 I was home alone watching t.v., my dogs began to bark, and I felt the house rumbling.  As if someone was listening to a loud stereo in front of the house. Instead of a rhythmic thumping, it was more of a constant stub-audible rumble.  I walked out front to see what the dogs were barking at and saw nothing in the street, but when I stepped out from under the eaves, I felt heat on my back.  I looked up and at tree top level above the house was a blue/gray glowing sphere.  As soon as I looked up, it took off due east, like it had been shot from a gun.  It got brighter as it picked up speed and about two miles it bounced north west, like a tennis ball hitting a brick wall.  After the bounce it was only visible for a flash and then disappeared.  Two noteworthy observations.  First, the sky was overcast with low clouds, and it was well under the cloud cover. Secondly, as it took off from over the house, I could feel a sub-harmonic vibration, in the driveway.  But it never made an audible sound.  There wasn't much to it, but it was a hair raising couple of minutes."

It was at least a mile ahead of me at the time, I could not get a photo, it was much too fast, within 4-5 seconds it had disappeared into the trees.

11/8/2012 21:30,Formation,over a hour,Paton, IA,42.16501525,-94.2550674,"A opening in space that formed a hole from which I could see many flying objects keeping the hole open.  I went outside to feed my cats at around 21:30 and living out in the country I have very few lights so I have a clear view of the sky.  As I bent over to put cat food in the cat&#8217;s bowls I saw a streak of light from the corner of my eye as I was beginning to bend over.  I looked up and the first thing I saw was how bright the planet Jupiter was and then I saw another blast of light which pinpointed where the first light I saw had come from.  I stood there in awe with my mouth open because I could not believe what I was seeing.  It was a clear night with a few clouds and a soft breeze blowing and what I saw was a hole in the sky.  It was dark outside but enough light to show that clouds were around this hole but not blocking it.  Inside this hole which almost seemed like looking through a tunnel, it was very clear through it almost like it really wasn&#8217;t our sky.  It was full of dancing lights that moved around all over the place and once in awhile they moved together in synch.   One more time I saw a blast of light come from something inside this hole that exited and seemed to go into our clouds.    The beam looked like this:   --------- --   ------   -- -------- -- ------------ -- ------------- -- -----------.     It was long and short beams going in a straight line. No sounds were ever heard during all this.  Most of the lights were red and white with a slight amber color on one.  It seemed they were working on keeping this hole open and around the outside portion of the hole in what I think were clouds; they seemed to be manipulating the clouds or something into something that would appear alive.  In other words, the outside of the hole along with the inside of the hole seemed like a living entity. It moved very fluently as if looking around.  I totally could not believe this and I ran in the house and called my parents to see if they saw anything from where they live 20 miles away.  My dad said he saw something in the east but I told what I was watching was South East I went to my neighbors across the road and they stepped out and I had to point it out to them where to look.  They both stood there in amazement and couldn&#8217;t believe it either how these bright dancing lights moved inside, and how the outer portions of the hole would move as if it were alive. At that moment two packs of coyotes started to howl and my neighbor&#8217;s wife went in the house. I came back to my place and called my dad and then I went out to see if the hole was still there. It was, but this time much fainter and fewer lights are in it.  I can handle lights in a tunnel like hole but it bothered me how it was forming shapes that almost seemed humanoid at times.  The best way I can describe it is think of yourself as a tiny ant inside a hollow egg.  Someone comes along and drills a hole in the egg and puts his eye up to the egg to see the ant inside. The ant would see you and see you moving from his perspective outside that hole. That is what it looked like to me.  A giant peephole with something holding this hole open manipulating the area around it and then moving this animated matter in the shape of an animal or human reaching and grabbing things. If the bible is true and they say god will open the heavens and you will see him then I think I just saw a practice run, because I still don&#8217;t believe what I saw, but I did, and it&#8217;s disturbing on"

Also I want to add that I thought the windshield of the car was making the object red.  My mom insited we pull over and get out and take a look.    We drove for  maybe a few more yards before we stopped.  Before we stopped my mom rolled down her window to see if we could hear anything.  Nothing was heard.  The best way to describe the range of the object from us was like at an Airshow.  The object then made a climb and the color began to turn from a dark red to a red with white in it.  It was stationary for a bit, then it continued on its path and the light just went out. I saw no landing light nor FAA lights on the object."

It looked like a mini sun that was just hovering there.  The middle of the huge buring object however was black and I noticed it looked like something in the middle of it was moving. When I got a better look it realized that in the middle of this burning ball of light was what appeared to be the shape of a human  only larger than any man that I have ever seen.

When the lights went out it was as if a door was pulled accross them from left to right and each one went out in this sequence.

I called my brother to come see cause I knew he would never beleive me if I told him what happend. The lights where North West in a funny formation. There was four of them.  Omost in a straight line except the second light was a little lower making what it looked like was a v shape.  The balls of light seemed to be flashing omost but more like flickering.

We told them we say a ufo and they just nodded and said they saw it to.   My dad is veteran and was telling me all these laws about plains in formations. And was saying things about how lights ate on plains but long story short he was saying there was no way those were aircraft.

The object was silent and appeared to be gliding in the sky.  The object was heading west, then turned at a 45 degree angle and headed to the north.  I lost sight of the object when it went into tree line.  It is also important to note that this park is very close to Glenwood Dr similiar location to the other Boulder triangle report."

It was traveling at speeds that I never witnessed a manned aircraft before, hence it was only in view from my windshield for 5-6 seconds before it was out if sight.  It seemed to have a helicopter shape but was to fast to describe other than the gape of a teardrop.  The color was steady and did not change from the reddish orange light it emitted. It also was not bright but bright enough to catch my eye."

On the way home from work at approximately 1940-1945 hours, I observed six bright stationary orbs in the sky to the north/north east of Wasilla, Alaska, as I drove north on a dark rural paved road. &#160;The objects appeared approximately three times the size of a planet such as Venus when seen in the dark night sky. &#160;The lights were not directly overhead but rather part way up on the horizon. &#160;Tonight the air was very cold and clear and all stars are visible clearly. &#160;The air temperature is between 15 and 20 degrees with very low humidity. &#160;The objects were orange in color and circular in shape.  I called a coworker who was.driving the same road in the same area and he said he was attempting to film the objects on his smart phone.  When I observed the lights/orbs, there appeared to be small red lights that would fall quickly off the objects traveling directly toward the ground in a straight line. &#160;The red lights would dim and go out in 3 to 5 seconds time. &#160;A description was like red hot slag that could be seen falling off a hotter orange main orb. &#160;I observed this on the majority of six orbs but not on all of them.  At this time I noticed that nearly every vehicle on the two lane highway headed in the northerly direction had stopped and citizens were observing what I was.  At this time I noticed that no cars traveling south were stopping, only those traveling north.  Four of the objects were aligned in a nearly straight vertical line with nearly equal distance of spacing. &#160;Two more of the orange orbs were slightly off to the east of the vertical four or to the right side as I headed north. Next, I turned off the highway onto a gravel road that headed west and parked my vehicle. &#160;I turned off the vehicle and all lights I had on. &#160;I exited the vehicle and looked to the north, I could no longer see the orange lights or orbs. &#160;To the south west/ west I could see one orange orb traveling in a southwestward/westward direction. &#160;I would estimate it was approximately 50 to 70 miles from my position and very high in altitude compared to normal flight patterns. &#160;If I was to estimate, I would say it was at 70,000 feet or higher altitude moving at a slow yet constant velocity. &#160;The rate of travel was approximately twice as fast as a normal satalite that you observe traveling in orbit across the night sky.  I called a coworker located 20 miles to the southwest of my position and the orb dimmed and disappeared a few seconds later before he could go out to observe it. &#160;The whole event lasted less than two minutes from the time I observed it until the last orb disappeared from the cloudless sky unobstructed by mountains or &#160;any other objects sans the stars. &#160;When I exited my vehicle when it was turned off, there were no sounds. &#160;No rotor noises, prop noises no jet engine turban sounds. &#160;Whatever the orbs were they were silent as I observed them and at no time did I see any navigation strobes or red/green navigation lights. &#160;I have no explanation for what I saw. &#160;I have observed metopes, satellites , military night rocket launches, aerial search and illumination flares and many things but none of these were like what I observed tonight, November 7, 2012 to the north east and south/ southwest of Wasilla, Alaska."

I also was able to photograph some of the lights which although having a full moon helped long shutter opening, were needed.   The light first light on mt whitney had disappeared when a few minutes later reappear with a second light and both light moved about the mountain until they reached the base, where they continued out onto the plain in front of the mountain for a few minutes then blink they were  gone.    This activity continued thru out the night, with one exception, a light appeared at the base of a small hill located to my left i watched as this ligh! t slowly moved toward hwy 395 then stopped and went off!  I wanted a closer look and moved without lights toward the small hill thinking a trail could be found that would lead me toward the mountain, but i only found a large field which confused me because my view had changed so back to old location was necessary, i was about to move on when i noticed that a light was moving towards my location from the hill slo wly using the trees and brush to hide its movement when it reached the last bush it bent over and rested on one knee then turned toward me.    This is what i saw the form was wearing a suit or something like that, light in color no other detail was viewed, a helmet was covering the head and was dark but for a copper like color coming from the inside view lens, I tried to use my glasses to see better but the form was not visable until i removed them, at this point my concern for my safety over came my interest to remain any longer so i left or tried to leave but was un! able to locate the exist which i had used to get into the fiel! d, stopp ed from going further i left my vehicle on foot to find the exist it took a few minutes but i found the track i needed getting back on to the trail there was a red blinking light to my right at first i did not notice but once i started to move so did the light when i stopped it did too i tried to creep slowly but this light maintained a safe distance from my vehicle. I finally got the camera out (Nikon D 3000 SLR) and started to shoot these light, there was a full moon that night but long shutter opening was necessary shooting the lights on the mountain was not good but taking the pictures of the red lights came out much better, I am not saying what i saw  i would rather hear what other see, but when i saw the first image on my camera i new it was time to get out of there quickly and that is just what i did! Once i was back on hwy 395 and just passed lone pine something i had not consider happened that red blinking light was now following me this i know because it appeared j! ust to my right and in front of my vehicle using the frontage road, my speed at the time was about 75 mph the light had no trouble keeping up nor did have trouble passing thru a second story building next to a railroad crossing pacing me for the next 60 miles until i stopped near red rock state park and could no loner see the light!"

No dust in the air.  Sightings (flap?): Driving from Bishop, CA to Tonopah, NV:  We approached Coledale Junction. I slowed and made the turn  from Hwy 6 onto Hwy 95.  I then saw a bright white light to my left. It was a craft flying less than 200 knots and in low level flight.  I assumed it was a training jet, or general aviation plane running North on Hwy 95 (towards Reno).  I  estimate that it was 2000 Ft. AGL, or lower. As it came abreast of the car and off into the desert &#188; mile east of the hwy, it turned into an orange glow and then dispersed in a shower of sparks like a meteor and trailed a comet-like tail and then burned up in level flight and was gone.  By the time I alerted my wife-she missed it. It was low and on the driver&#8217;s side of the car.  I assumed I saw a meteorite coming in-but was mystified by the slow, level flight pattern.  Then as we progressed Southbound on Hwy 95 towards Tonopah, I saw an orange circular light around two hand spans high in the windshield above the lights of Tonopah-some 12 miles distant &amp; high above the twinkling lights of Tonopah.  This was perhaps 7 minutes after the first sighting. I called attention to it and My Wife saw it too.  Then another orange glowing &quot;orb&quot; appeared to the right of the first one.  They were both spread out and at the same elevation-the distance of separation was the full width of windshield.  First the left one snapped shut-turned off.  Then the Right one went out. We both watched this.  As we approached our turn on Gabbs Pole Line road, these orange lights re-appeared-first the left one, then the right. It seemed they were stationary and in the same location still.  High above Tonopah. They stayed illuminated perhaps 20 seconds, then vanished in the same order.  We both saw these again.

A few minutes after apparent sunset on 11/7/2012 5:20-5:40 I saw an object begin glowing brightly about 6-7 degrees above the horizon, at this point 3 degrees above the sun (was obscured by tree line) the object was about the same angular size as Venus, maybe a little larger.  It was visible over the course of a minute, I first noticed it as a soft glowing object the same shade as the sun during sunset, but it got continuously brighter until I was able to see white light in the center, it quickly faded until it was just at the edge of my vision and then brightened up again.  During the phase where it brightened back up I noticed an identical object five degrees north of it, and 10 degrees above the horizon.  This one had a much shorter life cycle of about 20-30 seconds and did not re-ignite like the first object.  So transfixed was I on the second object that I did not notice what happened to the first.  After about two minutes of staring at the horizon trying to detect another I noticed a third object about 25 degrees directly above where the sun set, this one may have been in existence longer but I only saw it for about 5-10 seconds, which was enough time to point it out to a passerby to verify that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  She only noticed the contrail of a plane 10 degrees below object.  All three were exceptionally bright objects that did not move during the times they were visible (verified constantly with reference points on the Horizon), all presented with an orange glow similar to the surrounding sky during sunset, but they all at their peak brightness had a visible bright white core.  What I have concluded/believe:    1. They were not one object.  Two were visible at the same time.  2. It is not an airplane, or airplanes.  Angular size of light source, brightness and duration of visibility especially in close proximity to the sun would not exist without apparent motion.  3. They were not a satellite, positioning is too erratic, and they did not move. AND in order to produce a similar orange glow, light would have been reflected from the sun, but the objects were too close to the sun.  The only man-made objects to pass through area between sun and earth during time specified were ISS (ZARYA), Cosmos 2278, Atlas Centaur R/B and Okean-3.  None of which, according to computer program Stellarium 0.11.3, were in proper position or at proper times to be the objects spotted.  My mind first jumped to supernova, and second to aliens.

After we missed the Orionids, due to rainy/cold conditions, we made it our mission to see the Taurids early morning light show Nov. 4th and 5th.  We are both extreme creatures of habit, so staying up late to seek shooting stars has become our normal routine.  Together, we've probably seen over 75 shooting stars in the last 5 days, but what we saw last night was most certainly not like anything either of us has ever seen.  At around 3:15 am PST, my wife pointed at the sky to where she had just seen a bright flash of light between the constellation of Orion and Jupiter.  Being that we are very close to LAX, when I saw the blink of very bright white light a few seconds later, I immediately thought it was an airplane.  However the light did not appear to have any sort of intervaled blinking and it did not move.  It was Bright! Brighter than even Jupiter, which was to the NW of the flash.  Through my binoculars I saw the flash come and go about 4 times.  Each was abrupt, bright, and in the same spot between two very small distant stars. Based on the other celestrial and orbital objects around it, this light appeared to be coming from deep space.  No object or shape could be made out, but it lit up approx. 7 or 8 times within a minute and then disappeared.  I've spent the last 24 hrs researching Weather Balloon citings, Iridium Flares, and other logical explanations for what we saw.  None of them have even come so close as to mimick our happenstance.

At first, I thought it was someone shooting off fireworks.    Upon opening the curtains, we saw a slow-moving object flying lower than most planes (helicopter height).  There was absolutely no noise.  It had brilliant, FLASHING orange lights (like an intense strobe light) and a bright red light on top.    We could not make out a shape behind the lights.    It traveled from East to West in a straight line over the course of about ten minutes.   We've never seen anything like it before.

The sky was 100% cloudy, with rain from time to time. Stars and the moon were not visible due to the storm clouds covering the area.  As I traveled south a bright colorful light (blue, green mostly) began to flash within the clouds making the surrounding clouds light up with different colors. I thought this very strange and kept watching as suddenly I could clearly make out several round lights begin to take form from within the clouds.  Like the sun shining through thick clouds during the day, theses lights seemed to be the same size, giving the illusion that it was no higher up than a water tower, but I knew from the foggy mist overlapping the lights that the object was higher up. The lights were now solid and the pulsing flash had stopped.  Theses lights were perfectly spaced from one another giving me the idea that they were apart of one solid object. I could not make out the shape d! ue to the object clearly being deep within the clouds above but the lights were so bright that they shined through with no problem.  The object was moving incredible slow about the same speed as you would see a flock of geese travel.  I quickly decided to pull over and try to video tape it with my phone. As I got out the object was moving slowly over me heading west, for as low as it seemed to be the object put off no sound.  The lights were now  brightly white and were round in shape.  As I watched the object travel above, it presented itself to me with a natural flow, like it belonged in the sky.  I began to try and film the object but my phone could not focus on the lights or anything else in the dark.  The object then began to disappear in some thicker clouds and the lights began to fade away until I could not see them anymore. I stood on the side of the road for 30 more seconds and the pulses began to appear again but further in the distance.    (Lights formed a honey comb shape with another light in the center)    First draft i tried to make honey comb shape but after i sent it the shape then turned into a line. the object was a honey comb, pentagon shape."

Perhaps two lights or three, with colors changing.  Appeared to be on the other side of the Willamette - perhaps far away to the west/northwest.  It swooped down, and to one side, then up, to the other side - graceful slow movement.   Finally, as I was talking to the local news station (KATU-TV)it gradually dropped toward the horizon, at a curving angle until I could not see it anymore behind the trees and tall house to west of our building.

I live only 6 miles from the Kansas City airport so I am accustomed to seeing planes takeoff and land. I looked at it for a time and realized that it was making jerky movements preceded by a green flash. It was a light at high altitude, crescent shaped.    I watched it for half an hour and it moved repeatedly, then I sighted two more in the southwest sky. I also witnessed what appeared to be planes with red and white flashing strobes, and I assumed that it was military observation of the phenomenon.    Then I sighted two more in the southern sky.  After 22:00 the lights from a nearby shopping center were dimmer and I was able to see more right overhead and in the eastern sky.  I became unable to count accurately due to the number of UFOs in the skies.  Until last night, November 6, 2012, election night, I have been a skeptic and now I am a believer. I phoned my sister in Syracuse, NY, who is professor emeritus SUNY, during this sighting, since she attends UFO conferences and is a staunch believer.    She questioned me and was sure that I was in fact witnessing an event.    They looked different from stars which appear as a bright light that twinkles sometimes and do not move in the manner of water bugs on surface tension on a body of water like these objects did.    I am not sure of the exact duration of the event, because the election coverage was on TV and I went inside to see who was elected. I ceased watching at 22:00 and went back out at 00:30 and they were no longer there. The constellations had changed position, but that was all I saw in the skies by that time."

They were at that time in what looked like an L shape and stayed there for about 30 seconds, before suddenly moving in a SE direction. They looked at this point to be moving very fast, faster than you would normally see airplanes traveling overhead.  As they advanced it became clear that each blinking light was singularly attached to an individual craft.  They stayed in a formation of two lined up, one further out ahead and then two off to each side of the center formation.  There were no additional lights (headlight, wing lights, etc.).  The blinking lights were blinking so fast that it was almost like they were twinkling.  As they passed overhead, we could hear the sound of multiple engines (jet?)."

We got out and watched the lights which appeared round and orange in color.  They were not rapidly moving, but they were in motion.  I did not count but there was near 7 to 10 lights moving in random directions.  I could not tell how far or how big the lights actually were cause I did not any relative distance marker.  We watched near 20 to 30 seconds then the bright balls of light just disappeared.

11/6/2012 18:00,Light,1-2 minutes,Boulder, CO,40.08298568,-105.2163447,"4 orange lights hovering above/near Rocky Flats former nuclear weapons plant  On November 6, 2012, at approximately 6pm MDT, after voting at Centennial Middle School, my wife and I were walking back to our home in north Boulder.  At the intersection of 19th and Norwood, which is located at the top of a steep hill that faces south, we observed 4 bright lights near the southern horizon.  The lights were located on a bearing just east of south, probably about 170 degrees.  They were all the same brightness, evenly spaced, and resembled sodium vapor street lights; they were orange in color.  They were no more than 5 degrees above the horizon from our vantage point. The lights were stationary during the minute or so that we viewed them.  My wife is an adamant skeptic regarding UFOs.  Nonetheless, she readily admitted these lights looked &amp;quot;weird&amp;quot;.  My wife and I both have bachelor's degrees in physics and we have both studied astronomy at the university level, including considerable observational experience.  Neither of us thought these lights looked &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;.  I have a private pilot's license and I am familiar with the location and traffic patterns of all airports in the vicinity of Boulder.  Our line-of-sight to the unknown lights passed near the traffic pattern for the Rocky Mountain Regional Airport (RMRA) (formerly the Jefferson County Airport or &amp;quot;Jeffco&amp;quot;).  However I do not think these were conventional aircraft landing lights because  1) they were distinctly orange and not white;  2)  because normally we do not see landing lights from aircraft in the pattern at RMRA since the downwind leg for runway 29 R&amp;L points *away* from Boulder;  3) because there were *4* of them, all identical, evenly spaced, and they did not change their appearance at all during the minute or so we were observing them.  Normally, conventional aircraft landing lights only take on an unusually bright appearance (such as we observed) when they happen to be pointed directly at the observer, a condition that normally happens for only a few seconds when an aircraft is maneuvering in the pattern.  I was unable to imagine any plausible arrangement of conventional aircraft in the landing pattern that would produce the display of lights we observed.  In addition I should mention that the line-of-sight from us to the unknown lights passed more or less directly over the former Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility.  The lights (if taken to be similar in brightness to aircraft landing lights) looked as though they were located right over the former nuclear facility.  Although Rocky Flats has not been used for nuclear weapon production in many years, the author is aware that UFOs are often sighted near sensitive military installations, and thus thought that this detail should be included in this report.  I was conflicted about whether to file this report or not, since we do have a large amount of conventional air traffic in our area at nearly all times, and therefore it is conceivable that what we saw was an unusual configuration of conventional aircraft.  However I decided to submit this report because I have thought about this sighting a number of times since it happened and I really am at a loss to explain those lights in a conventional manner.  Also, I reasoned that perhaps others saw these lights and may have already reported them, or, if not, perhaps my report will catalyze others into coming forward with corroborating information.  As far as I know there has been no mention in the local media about such lights, but I did not do a thorough search to confirm this."

There were some light clouds but the object was far below them.  I tried to determine a shape which I never figured out but it was too compact to be an airplane.

After retrieving my binoculars to try and determine the source, I saw no aircraft but one more puff of cloud emerged similar to how shaving cream would come foaming out of a can.  These were not contrails,and if this were exhaust from an aircraft, it would have to be hovering, yet I saw no craft present near them.Just then two of the Thunderbird jet team entered into the air going roughly in that direction.    I continued to watch the area of the clouds as the jets went out of sight.Just then I saw a brownish green craft that appeared saucer shaped dart across the sky at sonic speed coming from that vicinity headed SW.Within minutes four! fighter jets emerged from the AFB, flew around near the area of the clouds,then returned to the base.The small clump of clouds that appeared from nowhere stayed as cloud vapor and did not dissapate as smoke might.I watched them slowly drift NW within the relatively calm air current for a half hour.I've never seen anything like this cloud birth before, and cannot possibly imagine an explanation for it."

SIGHTING  it was at this point an object emerged from the eastern horizon, flying east to west at over supersonic speeds. it flew maybe 800+ feet above (although not directly 'above', likely on its flank a bit as it was hard to tell from my angle) the chopper. it made no sound at all and gave no heat or other effects and crossed the entire sky in about 2 and a half seconds.  It had one indescribably bright light on the center of the object, that flashed at regular intervals. the 'light' had only a few chances to flash due to the objects' speed. the light was so bright, so intensely white that you could see every color of the rainbow streaming within the light. there were perhaps other, dimmer white lights that stayed on constantly, placed around the craft.  The main body of the craft was very hard to distinguish in the darkness, but the lights on its own body gave some ambient illumination to itself. i could barely make out the greyed outline of a bizarre, somewhat triangle shaped craft. when the light would flash, it would be blocked out by the intensity. when it was off briefly, there was still light emerging from the craft, although not as bright. the lights on the object far outshone that of the helicopters', even the moon. the light was distinctly inhuman.  Because of the sudden nature of the event, i did not really try to make sure i would remember the details of the craft itself, as i was still what i would describe as 'calmly-lobotomized', staring like an idiot into the sky away from their house as someone opened the door.  I believe there is a possibility that the chopper pilots may have also seen the craft, although given its speed and silent nature there is a chance they only saw a white flash in the corner of the eyes. Choppers seemed to remain in the sky for the rest of the night as i saw one driving a few hours later and also heard another when i got home.  I give an estimate of 900+ feet for the elevation of the craft, and perhaps about the size of a good boat, quit a bit larger than a fighter jet.  I have seen F-16s, F-15s, F-22s, F-18s, MiGs, at night, at day, flying high, low, supersonic, really slow, you name it. I have looked down the barrel an A-10 Warthogs' Gatling gun.  I  have seen b-2 spirits, Stealth fighters, both parked and flying in close detail(although men guarded the F117 nighthawk) i have been in a V-22 Osprey helicopter, hueys, Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawk, freaking chinooks.  I have been on countless commercial aircraft of all make and size my whole life.  This was NOT a known aircraft, to be certain. it demonstrated distinctly inhuman traits. if it was human, i conjecture top secret military craft.  It should be noted that this was certainly a 'craft', and not a natural phenomenon.  It was NOT a meteor or balloon of any type.  It was not ball lightning. it was not an aurora,a moon halo, it was not swamp gas, sun dogs, it was not a lenticular cloud, or any other type of electromagnetic/plasma phenomenon. it was not gary busey eyeing the world dangerously as he travels in his home-made craft powered out of fear and childrens' screams. it was not santa, it was not a satellite, it was not a missile test. as someone who is extensively familiar with both military/civilian aircraft and astronomical phenomenon, all i can say with absolute assurance is this was an unidentified, constructed object exhibiting inhuman traits flying in proximity to aircraft with zero explanation and no other way of seeing it was there (radar?) other than eyesight."
11/5/2012 22:20,Light,5 minutes,Tacoma, WA,47.25200308,-122.46097,"single low flying/floating/gliding ORANGE light in sky  I was driving home from work as usual. This occured between 22:15-22:25 PST. I was driving in a northerly direction, about 14 blocks away from my home when i noticed an orange light. At first glance i assumed it was a plane or aircraft of some kind. Then as I got closer, about 10 blocks away i noticed the light was still there, and it was rather large, not small like a plane light. I then as i was driving, I started watching for it to blink or fade away or turn like most planes in the area do. There were no other lights or aircraft lights or anything in the sky during this time.  When I first saw the light it was a little to the left of the road i was driving on, during the day there is a large tree at the end of the road where i turn and it was in that area. as I got closer the light had moved to the right side of the road. When I was about 8 blocks from home and still observing this light i decided to pull over to the side of the road because this was simply something i had never seen before. It was a VERY clear ORANGE light. Not flickering or flashing. It was roundish, maybe a little more oval than round, but overall just an VERY orange light.  At the time i thought it was a paper lantern for 2 reasons: #1 because it was SOOO low to the ground..maybe 200 feet up. Maybe a little higher, it was night time so judging distance was hard but it was a large light (street lamp size) so I assumed it was rather near to the ground..much closer/lower than i've ever seen a plane or even a helicopter. and #2 reason was because of the way it was moving. It wasnt moving at a fast speed like i would expect an aircraft or helicopter to move. In fact it's movement was more of a floating/gliding. However the longer i watched it the more i knew it was not a lantern, because it was a clear light, there was no lantern for a flame or anything to be encased in. It was a clear, orange light that was not flickering like a flame would. It was also very silent, i could not hear it passing by. there were no engines or blades or cars or music or any other type of noise.  So when I pulled over the light floated to the left side of the street again, passing over the road, but i could not see a shape associated with the light, just the light..and it just slowly meandered across the houses and trees to the left of the road, 1-2 blocks over. there are about 2-3 blocks on the left side of the road then there is a cliff going into the Puget Sound.  I watched the light for about 2-3 minutes while i was pulled over.  I would expect a normal aircraft/helicopter would have passed out of my line of sight during 2-3 minutes and would be heading off wherever it was meant to be but after 2-3 minutes i got a little freaked out that I didnt know what this light was so i drove the rest of the way home.  I did not see the light again after i drove off.  As for my background/description:  I am not the kind of person looking for UFOs or strange sightings, i have never tried to see things like that.  I am deeply interested in astronomy and when it's not raining/cold outside i usually have my telescope out in my backyard looking at the stars/moon, however i have never seen an object that i could not identify.  Other than a few meteors i havent seen anything unusual in the skies during the past month or two here.  I still dont know what i saw except that it was like NOTHING i've ever seen and i've been looking at the stars all my life.  It wasnt until i described the situation to a pilot friend of mine that i thought it might be a UFO because he told me that there are no orange lights in aviation.  That is how i came across this website and why i decided to share my experience."

Of course this could have been several separate lights moving in perfect unison, or a formation, but we perceived it as being a V shaped object.  The lights, four on each side of the V shape, were a soft light, she thought beige, I though beige but with an orange hue.  They were moving so fast, that maybe 10 seconds of good overh! ead viewing time was all we had, maybe less, after moving from an overhead position, as it moved south, it became invisible, that is to say it disappeared very quickly from view after being almost directly overhead.  I would call this a UFO, although I am skeptical and wonder if it isn&#8217;t just a military aircraft that I am not familiar with, but it would have to be completely silent, and really huge,   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

While driving down 17-A from summerville towards Moncks Corner, my wife and I observed three lights in the sky off to our right.  These lights looked like an airplane making a turn in the sky. What caught our attention was the altitude of said lights.  They were low for the planes we normally see flying over that area.  The center light was almost a blue with the two other lights on either side of it being orange and equally distanced from the center one.  Four more lights appeared to the left of the three already visible lights.  The way they appeared was one right after the other, almost like the runway marker lights of an airport, one right after the other. As soon as the fourth new light, or seventh total light appeared, all seven went out simultaneously and were not seen again.  The initial three lights were seen over trees, and guessing distance, I would have to guess they were between the area of Highway 176 and Cypress Gardens Rd.  The other four lights that appeared were seen over 17-A.  All seven lights were in a perfect line and spaced equally apart from each other.  The furthest left light was at the highest altitude with the furthest right light being at the lowest altitude.  The best description of the lights were almost flare like without the long falling, strobing, associated with flares.  The lights appeared to never move direction.  It was like a light switch, first they were flipped on in sequence, then they were shut off all at the same time.  The background for this sighting was a clear dark night, with stars clearly visible in the sky."

Just spent 20 minutes on the phone with Miami ARTCC (Center); would love anyone's insight here.  Bear with me, kind of a long, detailed story:  Flew back from FXE to TPF direct with my student tonight.  All of the Avon Park MOA's and Restricted areas were active/hot, and we could see about 6 F-16's (as per Miami center) dog fighting and practicing intercept procedures at 7000' and above.  Upon clearing the MOA and due east of Arcadia, what appeared to be a LED landing light abruptly popped on just above the cloud layer and immediately caught our attention.  It appeared to be about 500ft below us, at our 2 o'clock and figured about 5-7 miles, and looked as if it might be in conflict in a few minutes.  The light then started flashing, presumably because he saw us up ahead crossing and wanted to make his position known.  I turned on our landing and taxi light of the 182 to acknowledge, yet this other aircraft kept turning this light on at odd and random intervals until he went dark for about a minute.  Fed up, I asked the Miami controller for a traffic advisory on the aircraft at our 2 o'clock and about 3-4 miles.  He responded that he didn't observe any traffic in the area.  A little puzzled, I asked him if he had any primary targets in the area and he told me to standby.  A long 15 seconds passed by and the light appeared again!  This time it appeared to now be at our 1 o'clock but the light still pointed at us (?) and then quickly went out again.  The controller came back on and said that he had checked and rechecked his backup systems and assured me that there were NO primary(pure radar return) targets in the area.  Just when he said that, an aircraft behind us a few miles asked where we were, the controller told him, and that pilot reported that he was watching all of this happen AS well!  Then a third aircraft also chimed in and said he too was seeing the strange light and it was moving across the sky rapidly.  Three aircraft in all saw this.  The controller was completely bewildered at this point....needless to say, upon landing, I called up Miami Center.  I talked on the phone for 20 minutes to the D-Side of the sector I was in, who turned out to be a supervisor and was training the R-Side.  He too was sufficiently freaked out and confused along with the rest of the guys on &quot;the floor.&quot;   He said that in his 27 years, he had odd occurrences like this every few years and they usually turned out to be flares IN the MOA but never in this location, intermittent, and underneath another aircraft moving laterally.  He thought that it was a UAV (which is of course illegal to operate in the NAS), and that if it was, it could have been much closer to our aircraft than we had thought (that's always comforting to hear) and it would also explain why it was not on their radar if it was small enough.  I chimed in and figured that it started turning its lights on and off in an effort to avoid us.  This was not a flare or laser.  It changed position laterally and maintained its altitude."

Between 6:20-6:30PM, civil twilight, observed a series of six brilliant orange orbs ascending from the opposite shoreline, due west, and gliding SE.  Each light traveled about 1.5 miles at an altitude of about 250 ft before it disappeared from view and was replaced by another, aloft from the same location.  Through 10x25 Nikon binoculars I watched someone on the opposite beach involved in launching the last two of these lights.  Flashing a 5mW green laser in that direction seemed to have an affect: no further lights arose.  Immediately driving around the Milford marina to this opposite shore of the Gulf, I met a group of partiers around a bonfire who admitted to launching several kong ming type paraffin sky lanterns.  Two of these which failed to go aloft were still on the beach for me to examine.  MYSTERY SOLVED:  Milford obviously has more than its share of hot-air balloon/sky lantern users in various areas.  These are not necessarily hoaxers, mostly folks just out to have some fun.  The &#8220;swarm&#8221; of dozens of lights which I reported taking place on 10/13 originated from a sports bar/restaurant &#8211; some sort of celebration.  Therefore, to save others undue waste of time and effort, I offer&#8230; ANATOMY OF A FAUX UFO:  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BRIGHT FLAMING ORB WITH A HAZE AROUND IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IF IT APPEARS CIRCULAR, BUT ALSO APPEARS TO CHANGE INTO A CYLINDER, OR HAVE A CYLINDER ATTACHED TO IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A CANDLE INSIDE A BUBBLE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IT IF RESEMBLES A FLARE ATTACHED TO A PARACHUTE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IT THE BRIGHT LIGHT FLOATS OR GLIDES SOUNDLESSLY OVERHEAD ONLY TO FLICKER AND/OR SUDDENLY WINK OUT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IF IT SEEMS FLAME-LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS YELLOW-ORANGE-RED, AND ITS FLAME SEEMS TO BE SWAYING OR WAVERING, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  I realize how unusual these things appear &#8211; particularly since I have witnessed some types of them being launched right in front of me, and still could not determine what I was observing after a two month lookout!  However, this is a very popular fad and these things are plentiful, easily available and cheap.  So expect more of them just about everywhere.  The truth shall set you free."

When we came to a stop at the stoplight, there was an electrical wire passing between us and them so it was easy to tell they weren't moving except for the lower right one.  As they stayed in one spot in the sky as we were driving, like a star, we could tell that they were some distance away, perhaps in the atmosphere?  Apparently, others around town also saw them."

November 4th, 2012 -- Between 6:45 -7:15 PM  In Thomaston, CT in the vacinity of Highwood Farms, I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette, and at nightime when I smoke I like to stargaze, and I noticed a flashing light over the residential area (which used to be an area of multiple farms).  It was a strobe flashing light of white, green, red, and, blue lights all in random order. You could see the light shimmering in the sky, so to be sure it was not a star I went and got my rifle scope.  After staring at it through the rifle scope I noticed orange lights gaining altitude on the horizon.  These lights then connected into the stationary light.  It then got very bright for a split second as the lights intersected.  The orange lights then began to rise vertically.  The lights then began to start moving towards my direction.  As it was moving I noticed it was in a linnear pattern of four orange lights with a strobing white light flashing beneath it.  As it continued to move I then looked at it through my rifle scope and saw the lights then transform into a triangle of 3 orange lights with a white light on the bottom.  It continued on its course and as it passed, it made a strange &quot;voooooooooooom&quot; noise in a deep low octave.  About 3-5 minutes pass..  I returned outside to smoke another cigarette while I called my friend in Georgia, who has seen alot of UFO activity in his area.  While I called him I saw another light similar to the initial strobing light of multiple colors -- begin to rise from the horizon and then after a minute or two  It disapeered.  Side Note - When I first sited the initial light I ran inside to tell my dad and brother I saw a UFO, and my brother watched as the lights intersected and the orange lights began to fly and change formation.  I know what I saw -- multiple UFO anomalies in the sky.  Possibly a plane?   I don't believe so, aliens are a very real thing in this vast universe.

The lights were above the tree line and appeared to be very close to me.  I was worried that while I was sitting there the object/lights were going to fly over my house.  They appeared to be much lower than an airplane would fly.  I would estimate that they were approximately 100-200 feet in the air, maybe higher but definitely below the light cloud cover.   I remember thinking that when the object flew over, it was so low that I would be able to see all the detail and that frightened me.  The lights were gliding very slowly, not wavering from their position in the triangle and moving in a westerly direction.  The lights were circular in shape and were about 5 times brighter and larger than the brightest/largest star in the sky.  I watched the lights for about 10 minutes as they moved west, toward me, then they began to slowly fade until they appeared no brighter or larger than the average star.  I wish, in retrospect, that I had grabbed my camera but I was too scared/in awe to go get it while the event was happening.

The orbs had been right over where the ambulance and firetruck were and I'm not sure if that was just a coincidence.  My feeling of the objects was just amazement and awe.  After this happened I posted my sighting on the Mufon website. Well on November 7 I had another experience.  I was at the store the same store where I had first saw these orbs and went to swipe my rewards card and all 4 of the self checkouts simultaneously froze.  I didn't think anything of it but then about ten minutes later I was at a drive through restaurant and saw one singular orb, the same color and distinction as the previous ones.  I went to ask a group of people if they saw it too, turned around and it was gone.  Now this was bizarre.  When I told my wife she became concerned and told me that the only way to get rid of them is through prayer and she prayed that they will leave me alone.  Haven't seen anymore, but I am still curious.  I don't know what the hell they were.  I didn't follow up with Mufon because it is scary and I don't want any investigation as to what they are,  I don't think that I want to know.  Someone said they could be plasma balls controlled by magnetism, but I'm not sure what I believe or who is responsible."

As he crossed main st he saw a woman standing beside her car looking at the object and he called and told me to go outside and see it.  The object (apparent size of an aspirin) was almost overhead when I went out and it looked like a ring of red pulsing light or red flame with a yellow center.  When it was off to my south over Jordan lake it suddenly turned dim and shrunk, disappeared, then briefly lit up dimly and was gone. It may have gone into clouds.  As I was preparing to go back inside I saw another one coming from the north.  At this time I called my daughter across town and she and her husband went out side.  My husband was home now and he called my mother outside.  The second object looked the same as the first did going over but just a little past overhead the bright lights went out and we could see a grey glowing circle (Smaller than an asprine) with one small red light at the edge.  The light circled the edge several times then stopped in one place.  The object continued to the SW getting dimmer intil it was gone.  They were too fast and too steady for a balloon and they made no noise at all.  From my daughter's house (4 blocks east of me) they saw the second object to their west side-on and it looked like a ball of red flame with a yellow center going horizontally and they lost it behind trees and buildings.  My mother saw the second object as a red light but couldn't make out the grey circle.

There are many wind turbines in this area and we had just finished ascending a relatively steep hill when we saw what we thought was, at first, a shooting star.  However, unlike a shooting star, the light did not dissipate and the tail did not break up rapidly.  Instead, the object (and its long tail) maintained a strong, vibrant white light with what I saw to be brilliant blue undertones.  It appeared to be following a downward trajectory that, in relation to the horizon was angled at approximately 12 degrees.  Its descent toward the outlying areas of Goldendale was extremely fast.

Its vertical and horizontal movement is  I saw UFOs in the sky, which are much higher than a airline in terms of altitude.  The shape of UFO is the combination of two hemispheres up and down with a dish between them.  The radius of dish is twice of that of hemisphere.  I guess that it is the typical UFO shape. Its color is bright silver. It seems that they play around there. They flight up and down so easily and in curved path. In addition to that, the smooth and sharp curves are observed in the path of the UFO.  They disappear and appear in the sky.  The speed of UFO is amazing.  Since I saw the flight in the sky, I can compare between the UFO and the airline.  I can tell that the UFO can flight at least several times faster than the airline.  I think there are at least more than 10 UFOs.  The maximum number of UFO in my camera at the same time was 7.  Since there was no cloud in the sky and they were in the high altitude, it was not easy for people to observe it.  I don't think other people observed them.  I asked one of my friends to see that.

11/2/2012 23:58,Fireball,5-10 minutes,Marina Del Rey, CA,36.67600356,-121.7795102,"Red glowing, pulsating orbs flying low over Marina Del Rey.  One emitted a &amp;quot;search light&amp;quot; &amp;  they all disappeared in depth int  Marina Del Rey, CA just before 11:00 pm.    My husband and I had just laid down to go to bed.  We have a clear view of flight path for LAX.  Looked out our window and saw two glowing orbs that we thought were helicopters that were approaching, possibly looking for someone in the peninsula area, which is not atypical.  They were not moving very fast, they had an odd glowing red light unlike an airplane or helicopter- the orbs were slowly pulsating rather than blinking and the light was much brighter than any landing gear or anything.  I thought they were possibly far off on the other side of LAX, but an airplane had just taken off and clearly passed behind one of the orbs.    A third orb appeared and was in line of the other two.  The first orb turned towards the sea, and a fourth appeared in line behind the third.  I thought it was weird that they were so close and yet there was no sound like you would expect to hear from a helicopter, so I jumped up to observe them.    The first one, which had turned, was no longer red (perhaps the red was only in front) and proceeded out towards the sea in a straight line until the light simply disappeared into a pinhole size.  It was not like a shooting star, it simply faded like it disappeared in depth.  The fourth orb appeared to be about over the water channel and a light suddenly appeared to illuminate a large area (perhaps over the water) to the east of the orb, BUT there was no light trail emitting  from the orb, there was no visible  &amp;quot;spotlight&amp;quot; on the red orb, and the illumination was pinkish purple.  I watched these orbs turn out to the sea, and one by one they slowly shrank into pinhole size lights before they disappeared.  The orbs never appeared to bank and did not follow any common flight pattern.  I thought perhaps they were small planes, yet a small plane pasted a few minutes later- you could hear the small plane and it did not appear to shrink as the orbs did about ten m! inutes before.  Last night was extremely clear, and all the ai! rplanes in the area were flying in typical patterns, they banked out over long beach as typical and never appeared to shrink and disappear as the orbs had.   This was an unexplainable phenomenon.  I have grown up flying in small planes, including at night time, and these orbs were nothing like airplanes.  They flew low like helicopters but had no sound.  The light they emitted was so bright you could not actually see their shape.  The light that the fourth orb emitted over such a large area should presumably come from a visible spot from the craft- there was no &amp;quot;spotlight&amp;quot;.  These orbs disappeared more quickly and in such an odd fashion that it looked like an optical illusion&#8230; The pictures you have posted over the marina with the glowing orbs look like the same ones that were hovering over the Marina last night&#8230;.."

As I watched, I realized there was no break in the clouds &#8211; it was solid overcast and still raining lightly.  As I ran through what the object might be, I thought jet plane at first. It was much too fast for a small prop plane or a helicopter, but the speed could have looked like how a low jet might appear.  I don&#8217;t think it could have been a plane though, since it was only a solid bright white light &#8211; no flashing lights light an aircraft would have.  I thought it must be a satellite, but thought a satellite would be much higher, and above the high cloud cover.  Then, the thing that puzzles me happened.

11/2/2012 22:00,Unknown,15 minutes,Centerville, ID,-115.887741,43.913315,"Nightime sighting of craft making impossible movements for any sort of airplane  Figured I might as well share my experience with you, even though I have no visual evidence to support it.  I am white, 55 years old, and retired from the Navy a little over a year ago after 22 years of service. My Top Security Clearance is still active, though I am currently fully retired and not working.  I recently went on an Elk hunting trip with my brother who is 53, in the Boise National Forest.  On the night of November 2nd, we were camped a couple of miles outside of Centerville, Idaho in heavy timber country.  We were sitting around the campfire marveling at how clear a beautiful the stars in the sky were when you are out in the middle of nowhere with no city lights near you to hamper the view of the sky.  I had gotten up to go and get something in the camper on the back of the pickup and was looking at the sky as I walked to the camper.  When I got to the rear of the pickup, on particularly bright star suddenly caught my eye. I can remember being confused when I first saw it and thinking, &#8220;what the heck is that&#8221;?   The light coming off the thing looked just about the same color as the light coming off all the stars, except that it was substantially brighter than any other star in the sky, including the North Star, and about every 2 seconds it would pulsate to a very bright dark red color.  At first that made me think it must be an airplane, but there was no green light at all and the movements this thing made were impossible for any normal aircraft.  Also, the brightness of the lights seemed to shimmer because of its movements.  I stood there watching this thing for a couple of minutes and then yelled for my brother (who is a small plane pilot) to come look at this thing.  He came walking over, watched it for a few seconds and said, &#8220;What the hell&#8221;?  We watched this thing for a good 15 minutes make movements no normal plane of any kind could possibly make and at speeds that are equally impossible.  I have no idea how far away the thing was from us. If I had to guess, I would say it could be anywhere from 60 to as much as 120 miles maybe.  There was no sound associated with it and it had 3 very definite patterns to its movements which I would describe in the following way.  Picture the little + in the very center of a rifle scope.  This thing seemed to have the very center of that + as the center point around which all of its movements took place.  The first was straight up and down and straight side to side movements along the axis of that cross.  The second was a circular movement all around the outside edge of the +.  The third was the most incredible of all. It would make diagonal movements in both diagonal directions through the center of the +, but when it made this movement is was 3-5 times longer than its straight up and down or side to side movements.  At the distance that thing was from us, those diagonal movements in particular had to represent a distance of mile! s and it would do it in a couple of seconds.  Sure wish I would have had a camcorder with me, but at least I got to see it for myself and for several minutes.  It was pretty extraordinary and exciting!  Feel free to contact me if you would like, but I think I have pretty much covered what we saw!"

I explained to her that the this was much bigger than the Stealth and that the shape was wrong and that when I had seen it at night it was per the News Tribune a test flight to see how the plane would react to our rainy weather up here in Tacoma VS California.

I&#8217;ve never reported anything like this.&quot;  Police and fire officials in Waterville, Winslow and Oakland, as well as the Maine State Police, said they took no reports of balls of light in the night sky, and the National Weather Service reported no unusual weather that could account for the lights.  &quot;A string of lights [in the sky] is a very common UFO report,&quot; Alan Davenport, director of the University of Maine&#8217;s Jordan Planetarium, said Friday.  Some prior UFO reports have proved to be aircraft flying away, he said. They appear to be stationary because they are so far away.  &quot;That is what their taillights would look like,&quot; Davenport said.  Yardley&#8217;s wife, Rita, asked him why he didn&#8217;t take a picture of the balls of light with his cellphone, and he said he couldn&#8217;t because &quot;I was on the phone.&quot;  The National UFO Reporting Center, which has nine postings on its website from Maine for October, has taken reports of orange &quot;fireballs&quot; from all over the world.  There were no postings on the website for Thursday night.  There also are a couple of YouTube videos posted of people filming orange lights in the sky.

They looked like stars but I look often at the sky and my intuition told me they couldn't have been.  They appeared about 30 degrees off the ground but very far away and far to too bright to be an aircraft.    I thought I saw them move so i ducked a little to use my roof as a reference and I watched them go behind my roof, I continued doing that about 2 or 3 more times before i assured myself that they were in FACT, moving.    I ran inside to get my dad but when i got back out the front dot was gone and the one in rear disappeared as i stared at it pointing for my dad to see.  ====PLEASE CALL the 936-((number deleted)) number because the one i called on is my housephone====    ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellites??

10/31/2012 19:10,Cigar,10 minutes,Lakebay, WA,-122.757222,47.257222,"Three red lights on either end of cigar-shaped craft, large; moved forward, sideways, then back without turning.  I saw a UFO the evening of October 31, 2012.   At least it was U by me.  It was very large, cigar shaped (fatter in the middle) with three large red lights on each of the two ends.  I only saw it from one angle.  It moved toward me, it tilted slightly a few times (after I waved at it), then it went sideways, then it went back in the direction from which it had come, without turning.  It was just after 7:00 p.m.  I was sitting in my bedroom with just one low night-light on near the floor, watching TV, with all the windows uncovered so I could see the lights on the islands across from me.  (I live on a huge body of water in the state of Washington, 100 feet above the water, with an almost-180-degree view of water, and islands many miles away from me.)  It was a lovely night, clear, still, well lit by the near-full moon that was just beginning to rise.  I see planes across the way all the time, over land;  the only aircraft that fly over the water are recreational, flying low, usually only in summer and during the day and usually only amphibian planes.  The only aircraft that fly in my direction are military planes (sometimes) and helicopters (quite often)&#8212;and those are really loud.  Once I saw one of those black triangular military craft, flying so low and slow I wondered how it could stay up in the air.  I&#8217;ve never seen a military craft fly over this area, staying over the water like this.  This was way different.  So, I was sitting there watching TV and saw out the window some red lights flying slowly, quite low, across the water, coming almost in my direction (if they had continued this course they would have passed me to the North).  There were two groups of three red lights, big, with a wide space between&#8212;too wide for them to have been wing lights.  If they were wing lights, the plane would have had to be five or six times bigger than a 747.  Helicopters, I thought.  But I don&#8217;t recall having seen red lights on a chopper.  The two groups of red lights were flying in such synchronization I thought, wow, if those are choppers, the pilots are amazing.  So I went to the window to watch them.  They stopped moving and hovered.  Then I thought, what the heck is that, and went outside in the dark and walked across the lawn to the fence, at the bank above the water.  No noise.  If they were helicopters, I would have heard them.  The sky was bright for night, with high white clouds far above.  I could make out a faint outline connecting the red lights, kind of a cigar shape, fatter in the middle. Then I thought, cool, I think it is a UFO.  I put up a hand to beckon them to come closer to me ;-) The red lights began to wobble, as if the &#8220;cigar&#8221; was tipping back and forth, like plane wings would do if the pilot were goofing off.  Then they moved sideways, and then they started moving back in the direction from which they had come&#8212;without first turning around, they just started moving away.  I watched them until they disappeared in the distance.  UFO or &#8230; silent helicopters?  Does the military have silent helicopters with red lights?  It&#8217;s possible that my vision fooled me, that I didn&#8217;t see the cigar shape&#8212;but I doubt it.  If they were indeed two silent helicopters, they flew in perfect synchronization &#8230; and, they would have turned around.  So, I&#8217;m sure it was a very large cigar-shaped craft with three red lights on each end.  I&#8217;m 62, female, retired family law paralegal.  No mental problems.  IQ 138.  This is my first sighting of a UFO.  I wish I had got a photo of it, but I didn&#8217;t want to take the time to go back inside and get a camera, wanted to see it for as long as I could. I'll be watching with a camera nearby in case it happens again!"

It was moving so fast that it traversed the sky in less than a second.    As it was approaching the West side of the horizon, it turned its trajectory away from the ground and disappeared  from view.  It was totally silent and appeared to be fairly high up.

I looked away, then glanced back up, and noticed that the &quot;star&quot; was moving rather quickly from North to South.  I then noticed 3 aircraft that appeared to either be traveling in formation with the white object, or chasing it, coming up from the North of the object.  After about 10 seconds, I could make out individual strobes on the 3 aircraft, and a blinking red light on just one of them.  The original object was solid white, not blinking or pulsing, and did not have any red or green lights to it.  The intensity of the white light never varied.  About 10 seconds after this, the aircraft on the Northern end of the &quot;formation&quot; of 3 sped up, and placed itself on the Southeastern tip of the formation, and closest to the white object. About now, I could make out the body of the aircraft that appeared to be in the middle of the formation, and saw reflections from it&#8217;s strobe on the bottom of the airframe.  The objects proceeded directly South, with the white light leading the group and the 3 aircraft in apparent formation back to its North, Southeast and West.  The 3 aircraft following the unblinking white light never once overtook the (object), but stayed to its North, East and West, even when the Northern aircraft sped up to overtake the other two!  I cannot say for sure, but, I thought I could make out some type of structure to the object emitting the white light, because of the moon shining onto it.  Also, I cannot prove this, but, it kind of looked like the 3 aircraft in pursuit of the white light were staging themselves in position to visually observe the white object.  That is just my appreciation of what I saw, and how the 4 objects were traveling in relation to one another.  This did not appear to be a satellite, and it certainly was not a planet or a star!  The entire time I observed the white light, and the 3 aircraft following (or chasing it), was about 90 seconds.    My sighting ended when the lights went behinds a light cloud haze.

We waited about 10 minutes and then they appeared again.  They appeared and disappeared one at a time. We do not know how many there were.  This lasted for probably 20 seconds or so.  We waited again for about half an hour and they appeared again off in the distance.  They had moved quite a ways west but it is difficult to say how far.

At approximately 22:15 me, my husband, my sister and my two children witnessed for the third time this year and the second time this month, 3-4 bright, whitish/blue lights flashing in a diagonal line across the horizon in the southeastern sky.  The lights appeared to be circulating around an object and kept perfect spacing between the lights at all times.  The object itself was not seen, though as in a previous sighting, the lights tilted from a horizontal line to a diagonal line while moving from the southwest toward the northeast.  The sightings have all been at nearly the same time of night and always witnessed moving basically from the west to the east.  The disappearance of the object/craft is always at the same point from our perspective, being nearly due east.  Only from the lights can it be assumed that the shape of the object must be somewhat circular, as when it tilts, more lights are visible, as if seeing lights on both &quot;sides&quot; of the craft.  It was slow moving, there was no sound, no vibration, and no visual disturbances or obstructions with the exception of a very few sparse, low lying clouds beneath a full moon.  As for the three adults in this group: we range in age from 60, 56, and 41.  None of us are any more or less than average citizens and none of us uses drugs or any kind of hallucinogens.  We are, quite simply, hard-working country folk who have, for several years, been observing strange, random sightings in the night and day skies.  To us all, it seems as though these occurrences have become much more frequent and with greater diversity in shapes, sizes, light colors and duration.   I will note in all seriousness however, that twice in the past few years I mistakenly asked my son to get a camera and  each time I did this, the objects disappeared and did not reappear for many months.  I will let those of a more evolved intelligence deliberate on why this happens.  However, I will not make that mistake again; as in to attempt to document on film such an object and simply enjoy it for the show it provides us."

What I first heard sounded similar to this    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=081FuoN8K40    but after half a minute or so it came to sound more like an airplane engine, and then the craft flew overhead.  The speed seemed similar to jets I've seen in the sky, and the altitude I would say was around 15-20,000 feet. It was much lower than a commercial craft, but still fairly high to my eye, and the elevation of the ground where I was lay around 4,000 feet above sea level.  I'd never seen anything like it, and I was alone at the time in a remote area, with the nearest person many miles away. Naturally I was perplexed and a little frightened, but the day went on, and then today I found these two videos.

It was somewhere between 1:40-1:45 am.  I was looking at the stars noticing that the sky was very clear.  I was looking at Orion's belt when a very subtle &amp;quot;shift&amp;quot; or motion near it. It was very subtle, but as I focused my attention on it, I noticed it was a perfect v-shape. My instant thought was that it was geese because of the shape, but as I watched I was thinking to myself &amp;quot;no way&amp;quot; because it was travelling too fast, and the shape was a PERFECT v with no fluctuation.  It appeared to be a solid V-shaped object, based on the subtle line of the edge I could distinguish. I could only for certain see the V edges, and not sure about a third edge. It appeared solid and uniform.  I also could not make out any individual birds or wings, nor was there any sound that you would hear when geese fly by overhead. There was no sound at all.  I have never seen a flock of geese fly so perfectly in a v formation and that quickly.  It was  black on black against the night sky. I could barely make it out and would have NEVER noticed if it hadn't come into a very small field of vision while I was looking at the stars.  Even as I told myself it must be geese, something about it... I can't put into words ....made me feel like it definitely wasn't. It spooked me. In those few seconds my mind was racing to rationalize it. the V was, however, flying south-east, a direction I assume geese would fly this time of year. But it seemed to be a very large dark triangle/boomerang shaped object flying about the altitude of a regular plane and travelling quickly, maybe similar speed to some planes. I'm not good at giving estimates on size, or even distance in the sky, so could be unreliable on measurements.  I only got about 4-5 seconds of being able to see it before it blended into the night sky/too far away.  If it were geese, it seems like they would have been low enough to hear AND see (full or nearly full moon), and the speed was too great. I've never seen geese fly that perfectly in unison, either.  Maybe it was military aircraft??"

10/27/2012 23:15,Triangle,2 minutes,Arlington, TX,32.65849547,-97.13477,"Low rumble revealed sparkling lights, resolved into dark Triangular craft with lighting at two leading edges.  As I sat in my studio, I was beginning to get ready for bed.  I emptied my pockets onto my desk and thought that I should go out side before my shower.  As this was the second time in a few minutes that I had thought about going outside, I stopped what I was doing, lit a smoke,  and walked to the back door, opened it, and walked onto the patio.  I noticed that there was a distant rumbling sound that seemed loud, loud  enough that I wondered why I had not heard it inside my house.  The sound was much like the sound of a jet engine, without the usual high pitched whine.  Just the low frequency component of the sound like an Atlas rocket at a distance, or maybe a Harrier jet.  I am a professional audio engineer, and have very good hearing. I'll also point out that I grew up in the Land Surveying business, working many years in that field before my mid 20's.  Since the security lighting had activated when I went onto the patio, I reached my hand back inside the door and turned off the light to get a better look at the sky.  Still hearing the rumble, I looked up to see what it could be.  Above me about 60 degrees above the horizon, and due west, I saw an odd haze that would sparkle light, mostly white, with red and blue green. My first thought was that it was too low to be an airplane, and that it did not appear to be moving fast enough for flight.  The sound was incorrect for it to be a helicopter.  The lights seemed to twist and turn, with no discernible shape.  As the sky was otherwise clear, this confused me.  I noticed that there was an occasional brighter flash in red and then blue green.  The object continued to morph, and as I watched, it solidified into a shape.  It became an equilateral triangle with one end pointed directly south.  The object seemed dangerously close to the ground and just hanging there.  With my right hand outstretched to 30 inches, the object was about 9 -12 inches on each side, and about &#189; to &#190; inches thick.  The lights appeared along the perimeter of the two leading edges, with the brightest areas at the middle of each of those two edges.  I noticed that the southern most tip of the triangle had a soft white glow, and that the remainder of the bottom was a dull dark matt finish. The light area did not appear to be illuminated, only contrasted to the rest of the surface.   Much to my surprise, the bottom was not flat.  There appeared to be two large rectangular areas, one on each side of the center line, and while one was along the axis of (very slow) travel, the other was at 90 degrees to it.  The rectangular boxes had rounded edges.  I remember thinking, that this was not a good aerodynamic shape. Another incongruity.  Once the position of the object stabilized, the lighted edges were barely visible from my perspective, but the occasional brightening of the nearest mid-side light was red.  I thought, maybe they were FAA lights, so I waited for the next flash.  The flashing did not have consistent timing.  The next time it was green, and still hazy in a digital sort of way.  Checking the far side lights, I realized that they were also inconsistently colored also..  It was more like the lights were displayed as camouflage, something that would appear correct to the casual observer.  Wanting to take a photo, I realized that I did not have a camera on me, and that in order to get a photo I would have to get back into the studio, grab my phone off the desk and turn it on.  By this time, the object was already 45 degrees south of my position and I realized that I did not have time to get to the camera, and I decided to just continue watching.  The object continued south and within a few seconds had moved to the horizon, the sparkle growing ever smaller and less distinct.  I have some surveillance cameras located around my house, and I later checked to footage.  I left the studio at 11:15 pm CDT to go outside, and the event lasted barely 2 minutes.  I saved the recordings from the system and looked at it later, hoping that some more information could come from it.  The studio camera has an audio channel, but the camera over the patio does not.  I could not detect any low frequency information from the sound track, as the noise floor on such systems is rather high."

It just hovered and we kept asking each other if it's possible for a plane to hover.  Then i started thinking if there are even planes shaped like that. Next thing you know, one by one the dots flew away FAST.  They flew away like 5 seconds apart but when they did, the sky lit up. It was creepy.   I'm certain others have seen it, but our community is filled with people who just don't care or assume they are fireworks.  Others would rather keep the info to themselves.

I was walking down Metropolitan Ave in the Bronx (Parkchester area)by the Macy's Department store.  I happened to look up at the sky and through a clearing in the clouds witnessed what appeared as two bright, orange glowing orbs flying in formation at a steady speed to the North-East. They did not make any sounds as attributed to regular aircraft.  There were no blinking lights as you would most likely see on regular aircraft.  I observed them for approximately 30 seconds moving through the clouds (the clouds would obscure them at times) until they started to move behind the buildings in the area and I lost sight of them.  As I tried to move to the other side of the street, I witnessed the third glowing orb flying the in the same direction, but far behind the other two bright glowing orbs.  At that point I called my brother in the Westchester Square area of the Bronx, and asked him to access the rooftop of his building to see see if he could observe what I was looking at.  He saw all three glowing orbs in the direction of Parchester as they flew in the same northeasterly direction, and continued to observe them until he lost visibility due to the cloud cover.  He also did not notice any blinking lights or sounds. I was a practicing amateur astronomer for several years, and I would not report this if I knew they were ordinary astronomical phenomena.
