I walked outside to lock my car and looked up and saw the light in the sky, I didn't think anything of it until I realized it was very cloudy.  I sat outside in my car for a little while just watching it for about 15 minutes.  My husband came outside wondering what I was doing and he was amazed he had never seen anything like that either.  A few minutes later I got a phone call from my niece who lives about ten minutes away asking me if I saw a strange light outside towards the south over the mountain, she was doing some homework for her astronomy class in college.  We were seeing the same thing, she got off the phone to call her professor to see if he was seeing the same thing and I did not hear back from her.  But she said it was roughly 30 degrees to the southwest of Jupiter and roughly 50 degrees south south west away from Sirus whatever that means.  I took a video of the strange light in the sky.  It was changing colors, pale blue, white, orange, green a! nd red and it was flashing in and out.  There was no sound.",

I was outside walking my dogs and looked up at the south eastern sky around Jupiter, there was a bright blue light (the same color blue as the lights from a police car).  It was about 5 inches to the right of Jupiter.  It was dim and got really bright and then just blinked out in just a matter of a few seconds. It is a cloudless night and the moon is not visible.  I was the only person that I know that observed it because I was walking my dogs, my dogs acted as if they were scared because they all came in within a minute of the sighting which is unusual for them.  I call myself a hobbiest astronomer, I do know where some things in the are in the sky.  I normally have my cell phone with me but tonight I forgot it in the house before I walked my dogs.",

Not a bird as it had no wings and was utterly silent.  It did not lose any altitude and was so dimly lit that it disappeared as soon as it passed over.

On the evening of November 14th I was driving home from in the western suburbs of Knoxville, Tennessee on Westland Drive.  I was headed east when I noticed what appeared to be a very low flying airplane in the distance.  There is McGhee Tyson airport about 8 miles to the southwest, so I didn't, at that moment, think it was out of the ordinary, except for the altitude it was at.  For the next 45 seconds I had a clear view of this craft. I kept waiting for it to pull away and gain altitude, but as I got closer, I realized that I was gaining on it.  I slowed down as I got closer and realized that it was hovering about what appeared to be 400 feet above the road.  It had two white lights on either side of what I first thought were the wings, with a red light blinking in the center.  As I got closer and closer, now only going maybe 20 miles an hour I had a totally clear view of this craft.  As I drove under it, only then was I able to see that it had an oval or rounded shape to the underside of it.  I really wanted to pull over, get out and observe this craft, but I was just a little freaked by the whole experience.  As I drove away I kept looking in my rear view mirror, but never saw the lights or craft again.  I would really like to think that it was a plane or helicopter, as it was hovering, but I know of no plane that can do that and I've seen too many 'copters and it made no noise that I could hear.  The exact location was on Westland Drive right across from A.L. Lotts Elementary school.",

As it came overhead you could see that there was no structure on fire but just this huge ball of fire moving silently through the sky.    As it went on to the south it appeared to veer to the right moving westward and continued until it went out of sight over the horizon.    This thing cast an immense glow and you could see the flames jumping and flickering.  You would expect to hear something as you would with any other craft passing overhead but it was silent.

Altitude could not be determined but it appeared lower than most aircraft that do high flyovers but not as low as aircraft landing at the local airport.  I watched it through my 10x50 wide angle binoculars and could not see any flashing colored lights like commercial aircraft have.  The sighting lasted about 60-70 seconds and never deviated from it&#8217;s course.  This is the third time I&#8217;ve seen this in the last three years from my back yard. Always the same description, position, heading and speed. (On one other occasion, that my 9 year old daughter pointed out to me from our back yard, the object looked like a blueish-green light circulating counter clockwise, like it was in a circular flourescent bulb, at the same position, speed and heading as the three bright white orb sightings).  Afterwards I immediately checked the real-time ISS position but it was over Europe so it was not that, also it does not follow a direct straight west to east direction.  It had the brightness and was as large as Jupiter or Venus would appear but only moving much faster.  BTW Washington DC is directly east of me and many military bases are directly west of me, not that this has any known correlation.",

Standing up and looking over the annex's roof I saw a flat darkened object coming at me from the direction of our county airport. I thought to myself, &amp;quot;the FFA is going to pull this guy's licence&amp;quot;. The craft was no more than 100 feet off of the ground heading straight at me. As it got closer I noticed no tail on the craft and sounded as if it only had one jet engine. In front of it were what appeared to be two huge white lights projectinting out in front of it.  As it came closer it began to fly over the other side of the street on which I live and the detail was remarkable.  The craft was triangle shaped and painted in standard navy gloss grey top with creamey white belly. It was absolutely cleane no dirt streaks or oil on it.  What appeared to be a weapons bay was open and ran most of the full length of the craft.  There was no cockpit so was a remotely steered craft.  No markings of any kind could be seen but the weapons bay was lit up and you could see ribbing? and tubes for electrical or hydraulics inside.  The amazing thing was it's speed it was moving about the speed of a man fast walking.  A standard airfoil would not keep this craft up. Since it was running flat at very low speed the only thing floating it was probably a single gas jet generator pruducing some form of ionized, capacitive lift.  It was about the size of a large single engine private plane up to a private twin.the tail terminated in what appeared to be flaps that were set neutral   and again gave no assist in lift. most likely this is deriviant of the Bifield Brown lifting concept. It continued on in a wright Pat direction.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))",

I was driving west on Princeton Road in Hamilton, Ohio.  I had in the car my youngest son (8-yrs age), my daughter (16-yrs age) and two of her friends (both 16-yrs).  It was starting to get dark and lights in the sky caught my eye.  I was turning off Princeton Road taking my daughter's friend home and this allowed us to park the car.  We got out and watched the lights which appeared round and orange in color.  They were not rapidly moving, but they were in motion.  I did not count but there was near 7 to 10 lights moving in random directions.  I could not tell how far or how big the lights actually were cause I did not any relative distance marker.  We watched near 20 to 30 seconds then the bright balls of light just disappeared.  My daughter compared the sight to an animated movie caused Tangels where Chinese lanterns were set off into the sky.  I don't know what we saw but it was an event unlike anything I have seen.  I am forty-five yrs age and never give! n UFO sightings much thought only in the movies.  But we saw something that may be can be explained by facts that I don't know about like Chinese lanterns or bright hot air balloons.

At approximately 3:50pm, I noticed as I was looking towards Dulles Airport, what appeared to be at first glance a 747 headed towards dulles to land.    As I continued to look, I noticed 2 things.  I thought it was too large to be a 747 and that it wasn't moving. I had to take the Lansdowne Blvd. exit within about 30 seconds of spotting the object and when I searched again after getting off the exit, I couldn't see it due to the trees and buildings blocking that area. I was able to grab my camera and take a photo at full zoom. I'm sure with some analysis it can be determined if it is a 747.  The only alternatives I can think of are a blimp or balloon, though in my own mind, I don't think so.It was gray, shiny and metallic looking.  If anyome else saw this, I'd love to know.I'll look for more posts.",

This is the first time I&#8217;ve experienced this, so I didn&#8217;t think to take any pictures.  It was a large, diamond shaped bright light in the sky.  It was pretty high up, but we were on Jacksonville Road in Homer City, PA, and its wide open fields for miles.  When we first spotted it, we just thought it was the North Star, but as we kept looking at it, it got larger and brighter. It also shot a very bright light into a field, and also on the tree tops.  It wasn&#8217;t moving at all at first, but as we kept driving it started moving away from us.  That&#8217;s when we drove a little faster around this bend, to find it completely vanished out of the sky.  We looked for it the whole way home, but we never saw it again.  From the time we first spotted it, to the time it disappeared, it was only about 7-8 seconds.  I&#8217;ve never seen anything like that before and my friend and I would really like to figure out what we have just seen in the sky.  Thank you.",

As we got closer to home the object started to move without sound or blinking light, and as it was moving it started to fade away until it was no longer visible.    We were shocked and both agreed it was very strange and tried to come to reason with what it could be.    My theory is it may be some type of spy device that surveys an area and disguises itself as a star so it doesn't seem suspicious then when it moves it fades away so no one can see when it moves to another area to survey.",

The lights appeared not to be reflections, but emanating from whatever the craft was itself.  They looked perhaps like the fire one would see from a jet propulsion engine, but they were vertical rectangular/cylindrical in shape.  No trail, as one would see with a con-trail from an airplane, was left.    The two witnesses thought perhaps it was the international space station, although it looked to be too large and too close to be so.    It drifted slowly from the West/Northwestern sky to the Northern sky as its distance became greater.    The two witnesses watched as the craft went between the clouds and the horizon, in front of the clouds, so the two witnesses realized it must not be anything too far in the sky.  It appeared to be flaming, as a comet would.    As it drifted further away, the two witnesses conferred that it could still be seen at a distance of at least fifteen miles.  END REPORT.

When the lights went out it was as if a door was pulled accross them from left to right and each one went out in this sequence.

I was on the back porch of my home looking to the north,north east , away from the moon which was approximately 180 degrees the other direction and below the tree line. This is my largest view of the night sky as i am mostly surrounded by very tall trees.  I was sitting facing this direction and noticed 2 bright reddish orange lights emerging over the tree line at 30 degrees off compass north, which is my horizon and the lowest tree line in sight.  The lights appeared about an inch apart from my point of view moving from what appeared to be an East to West bearing.  The lights were bright but not as bright as Jupiter which was off to my right which i see regularly and is often the brightest object in the sky other than the moon.  The sky was completely clear, and i could see stars on the tree line/ horizon in the background, as well as a few passing/blinking planes in the same approximate area as for comparison. I am very familiar with the air traffic around this area and am very familiar with the the flight paths over this area as it seems to be a relatively high traffic area for planes.  However this was nothing like anything i have seen for myself before.  The 2 lights we diverging and disappeared in about 10-15 seconds.  They seemed to be ascending horizontally rather than any sort of decent, as possibly a flare would have, and were moving at a steady rate.   The relation to each other was about 12 o&#8217;clock and 5 o! &#8217;clock top to bottom, as if a plane was on an extremely high banking maneuver, although the lights seemed much too far apart and to quickly moving to be one object.  I quickly determined that these lights were not connected because they seemed to be drifting apart from one another while holding their bearing of East to West while moving at their own independent rates of speed.  When i stood up out of curiosity and took about 3 steps forward, about 10-15 sec later, 3-4 more of the same objects appeared as the 2 before over the same spot heading in the same direction.  My house is situated on a hill and i immediately went up the hill to gain a better perspective and as i did a total of 6-7 lights appeared moving in this similar direction.  I grabbed my iPhone and began recording what i could.  It was completely dark so i didn't know if they would show up or not, but despite the neighbor&#8217;s patio light glaring against the camera i managed to capture s few of the lights.  Unfortunately i stopped recording on accident when i starting moving up the stairs to the top of the hill, so when i got to the top i started another recording.   Although ! you can make out some of the lights in the video it really does no justice to the sighting as i was filming on a phone at night and had a bad glare.  I happen to be a videographer/ video editor and hesitate to post the footage due to its poor quality even though some of the lights are visible in the video it is certainly not a definitive piece of evidence in any way as to what these lights were or really even their bright reddish orange color. Mostly it will serve as documentation to myself that it actually happened.  With in about a minute all of the lights disappeared in front of me, not in any kind of sequence and although they were flying in some sort of formation relative to one another,  there was no recognizable pattern.  These lights were not blinking but had some sort of vague pulsing regularity that never stopped until they disappeared.  There was also no noise whatsoever before the sighting, during or after.  I stayed for about 20 min examining the sky for any further explanation but had no further sightings.",

They were traveling too slow to be a plane, too fast to be a blimp , and there was virtually no noise to them.   On the little bit of video I captured ( I ran into the house for my phone when I realized I might be seeing a UFO ), you can hear a regular plane flying over our heads about a mile away. These orbs came over the treeline, maybe 300 feet over our heads and travelled close in proximity and in unisone. As the orbs flew off, they were joined by two more, and seemed to line up on top of each other, forming a triangle.

    "comments": "A friend and I we're driving down a country road shortly after mid night when I noticed a very bright star or planet that almost just appeared.  It was Orange in color and was very bright, we were in awe of its size and brightness.  As we were looking and trying to determine what it was it started to move very slowly and take a triangle shape with twinkling lights on each point of the triangle, the lights were almost pulsating.  The craft kept moving in a very slow, linear path that looked like it was coming directly towards us.  It passed just to our right and was only 1,500-2,000 feet in the air, as it came closer we quickly determined it wasn't any airplane or helicopter because it made no sound.  When the craft passed us we noticed 3 more with identicle shapes appear, they were also moving slowly and had the same linear path just spaced further apart.  As we watched the other crafts as they moved closer we noticed one craft that was almost directly infront of us drop a small, light-like object to the ground.  My friend and I were already kinda freaked out about seeing these objects and became almost scared when we saw one drop something to the ground.  These crafts continued their straight, slow paths and when they passed they just sorta disappeared.  We drive for another 5-10 minutes before arriving at our destination, when we arrived we continued to look in the eastern sky where these crafts were coming from and ended up seeing three more that went right over our heads.  We got very good looks at the ones that went right over our heads, they were definitely large black triangles with lights on each point and a few lights in the middle and along the edges.  They were moving very slow and had no sound until they were just past us, then we heard a very light propulsion-like engine sound.  All of these objects basically just appeared and were all uniform in size, shape, and color, but their lights differed in slight color and patterns of the pulsations.  My friend and I are just a couple regular, football loving, family guys and neither one of us have ever seen anything that compares to what we saw this night.  After seeing these objects we tried to come up with logical explanations as to what these things were and we came up with nothing.  Neither of us are aviation experts, but due to the size, altitude, sound, and light configurations we were both very confident these objects were not planes or helicopters or weather ballons.",

While driving down 17-A from summerville towards Moncks Corner, my wife and I observed three lights in the sky off to our right.  These lights looked like an airplane making a turn in the sky. What caught our attention was the altitude of said lights.  They were low for the planes we normally see flying over that area.  The center light was almost a blue with the two other lights on either side of it being orange and equally distanced from the center one.  Four more lights appeared to the left of the three already visible lights.  The way they appeared was one right after the other, almost like the runway marker lights of an airport, one right after the other. As soon as the fourth new light, or seventh total light appeared, all seven went out simultaneously and were not seen again.  The initial three lights were seen over trees, and guessing distance, I would have to guess they were between the area of Highway 176 and Cypress Gardens Rd.  The other four lights that appeared were seen over 17-A.  All seven lights were in a perfect line and spaced equally apart from each other.  The furthest left light was at the highest altitude with the furthest right light being at the lowest altitude.  The best description of the lights were almost flare like without the long falling, strobing, associated with flares.  The lights appeared to never move direction.  It was like a light switch, first they were flipped on in sequence, then they were shut off all at the same time.  The background for this sighting was a clear dark night, with stars clearly visible in the sky.",

The one on the top was slightly to the right in relation to the one on the bottom. They looked bright and big (size of Jupiter or slightly bigger) with a deep color of orange/red.  As they began to move from left to right slowly, I tried to get a better view through the branches of the trees in my yard which were partially blocking the view. I was curious to find out if they were planets but once they began to move I thought it could be a plane. But then, 2 planes one on top of the other didn&#8217;t make much of a sense to me. So I called my husband to come outside and look at these lights. He came out and looked but was too concern on stepping on dog poop outside. It is cold tonight in the 40&#8217;s. So he came inside and didn&#8217;t want to bother being cold. I was still curious to find out what it was as the 2 lights continued to move from left to right. All of a sudden I see then 3 lights. If I were to connect the dots they would form a triangle in the sky about 4 inches apart from each dot. The color of the dots were exactly the same color as the other 2 lights. As this happened, I ran inside to call a friend of mine so she could go out and look at the west sky ! to see if she could see the same lights. The 3 lights began to move from left to right and instead of 3 dots I could only see 2 kind of horizontal lights from each other moving again from right to left (west to southwest). It seemed like the lights would move and stop.  The one far left kept going while the one on the right stopped and dimmed to no light at all.  I moved my position down the driveway toward the south so I could keep an unobstructed view of these 2 objects.  The light on the right continues to move slowly and more dimmed but I still could see it. All of a sudden the light that had dimmed before came back on with a white brightness just like a flood light shinning down and immediately dimmed to no light again.  It seemed like this light had appeared for 2 seconds disappearing again completely.  It was very cold and since I had no jacket, I just noticed the light from the left continue to move southwest and getting dimmer and dimmer.  After I called the center to re! port this sighting, I went up to my husband&#8217;s room to ask if h! e did or did not see any light.  He told me all he saw was one red light.",

My neighbors were traveling on this road as were many other people, most of whom stopped along the side of this causeway as they did, to stare and wonder.

That many of them would definitely have been heard.  But from these, no sound emanated or was heard.    Also, they explained that these lights diminished in intensity, or in number, from sight as a few at a time and eventually all of them, faded out of sight, like wicker oil lamps being turned down then off.",

Then I thought I was seeing a shooting star or meteor because it most definitely was not a plane, but I realized it wasn't moving or flickering at all it was constant!  What I saw was to the right about midway up my windshield.  It was bright amber light and stationary.  It was cigar shaped and at a 45 degree angle like this: /  I did a double take, thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me and when I refocused my attention on the sky, I noticed that there were multiple &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; lights...again all stationary and at a constant brilliance, at varying distances.  In addition to the closest one, which was the most noticable, I realized that there were at least 2 more in the same direction (looking toward the Chichester Ave. Exit sign), but further in the distance - like toward Brandywine Creek State park.  The 4th I noticed disctinctly to the left in my range of sight, more toward the direction of the Delaware river.  I could not pull off due to the volume of traffic, but mkept my focus on the objects until they fell out of my range of sight.  I could see all 4 objects throughh the trees until about the split for 495 south.  Once I got onto 495 South, I could only still see one of the objects.  It had gotten very faint like it had travelled a great distance in an instant.  It was as if it had moved from the direction of the Brandywine Creek State Park more toward the direction of Kennett Square PA, but it could also be a result of the route I was traveling.  I called the hotline at about 5:09 pm, and was instructed to complete this form when I got home.  I have always believed in extraterrestrial life, however, I am extremely logical, and pragmatic.  I have NEVER in my life experienced anything as distinctly concrete as this sighting that would lead me to filing a report, but I very much want to find validation that I'm not the only person that witnessed this event.",

About a minute later for some reason I looked directly overhead in the sky and something caught my eye.

I didn&#8217;t know what to make of it and I quickly yelled to my friend to look up and he witnessed the exact same thing.  Three orange orbs then proceeded to almost sort of zig-zag/shake in a formation and then took off at an incredible speed.    I have always wanted to see something like this and I was in complete shock after seeing this.  It was hard to tell if these orbs were one solid craft or three independent things because of the maneuvers it did.  From being directly overhead for about 10 seconds it shot off and was gone and out o! f view over the horizon within 5 seconds.    We also heard helicopter noises that were not far behind, seemed like they were nowhere near it.    What made this even weirder was a few days after I went on your National UFO reporting website and saw that many people have been seeing the same exact objects.

    "comments": "At 7PM my husband was driving through town when he noticed a big flame shaped object (apparent size of an asprine) coming from the NW (Grand Rapids area)and it turned more southerly over town. As he crossed main st he saw a woman standing beside her car looking at the object and he called and told me to go outside and see it.  The object (apparent size of an aspirin) was almost overhead when I went out and it looked like a ring of red pulsing light or red flame with a yellow center.  When it was off to my south over Jordan lake it suddenly turned dim and shrunk, disappeared, then briefly lit up dimly and was gone. It may have gone into clouds.  As I was preparing to go back inside I saw another one coming from the north.  At this time I called my daughter across town and she and her husband went out side.  My husband was home now and he called my mother outside.  The second object looked the same as the first did going over but just a little past overhead the bright lights went out and we could see a grey glowing circle (Smaller than an asprine) with one small red light at the edge.  The light circled the edge several times then stopped in one place.  The object continued to the SW getting dimmer intil it was gone.  They were too fast and too steady for a balloon and they made no noise at all.  From my daughter's house (4 blocks east of me) they saw the second object to their west side-on and it looked like a ball of red flame with a yellow center going horizontally and they lost it behind trees and buildings.  My mother saw the second object as a red light but couldn't make out the grey circle.  She said she saw a red ball the size of an orange later that night(we went to bed around 10PM and it was after that) out her east facing bedroom window and ran to turn the lights off for a better view but it was gone when she got back to the window.

    "comments": "Bright, glowing reddish-orange fireballs in the evening sky.  On Saturday night, November 17, 2012, between 6:10 &#8211; 6:25pm (EST) my wife and I saw about 20 large, bright, glowing reddish-orange spheres (or &#8220;fireballs&#8221;) in the evening sky, over a period of approx. 15 minutes from our front porch in Hampton Borough, Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  The sky was perfectly clear, with low humidity (the Dew Point was about 25 degrees F) and the temperature was 38 degrees F.  There was a bright, waxing crescent moon to the southwest.  When I initially stepped out onto my front porch, to let my dogs out, I noticed two pairs of large, very bright reddish-orange glowing lights that were roughly spherical and could be described as &#8220;fireballs&#8221; that seemed to &#8220;float&#8221; in the sky, although they were clearly moving slowly in a straight line from the east-southeast to the northwest.  As the first pair got closer, they appeared to get a little bigger, until they were about double their initial size.  As they got directly overhead, they appeared to gradually fade, until they eventually disappeared, somewhat like a light dimmer.  Over the next 15 minutes, my wife and I saw another 15, or so, identical &#8220;fireballs&#8221; rise over the treetops of the mountain to our east-southeast, always travelling in pairs, in groups approximately 30 to 60 seconds apart, and always emanating from the same spot on the eastern horizon.  They all travelled in the same straight line, toward the northwest, seeming to &#8220;float&#8221; in the sky, but! making slow progress to a position directly overhead in a leisurely span of time of about 45 seconds to 1 minute, before they all gradually faded away over a span of about 10 seconds.  Since the mountain is about 1 mile from our house, and it took the &#8220;fireballs&#8221; about 1 minute to get directly overhead, I would estimate they were travelling at about 60 miles per hour.  They seemed to be fairly low in the sky, and I would estimate their altitude to be about 2,500 to 3,000 feet above us.  Their reddish-orange glow was constant &#8211; that is to say they did not &#8220;blink&#8221; like the lights on a plane or helicopter. There was no tail or flames &#8211; just a steady glow.  The way they seemed to &#8220;float&#8221;, or &#8220;hover&#8221;, seemed somewhat like a helicopter, and the way they arose over the horizon, always in pairs and seemly in a type of intentional formation, seemed to both my wife and I reminiscent of the helicopter scene in the movie &#8220;Apocalypse Now&#8221;. These &amp;quot;fireballs&amp;quot; made no sound.  About 5 minutes from my initial sighting, I decided to call 911, to find out if other people in our area had noticed and reported these mysterious glowing lights.  The 911 operator said no one else had called, and suggested they might be a meteor shower (which they were not; meteors move much faster, are much smaller and burn white hot, not glowing reddish-orange, like a fireplace ember).  She connected me with the New Jersey State Police Barracks, who dispatched a Trooper to our house.  By the time the Trooper arrived (about 15 minutes later, around 6:35 pm), the glowing lights has vanished.  He was very nice, but said no one else had reported seeing the lights.  My wife and I would be very much interested in knowing if anybody else reported seeing these glowing lights on the evening of Nov. 17th &#8211; they were the most unusual things either of us have ever seen and we would like to know an explanation for them.  My wife is a Registered Nurse and I am a Civil Engineer and! Geologist, and we have an intense curiosity to understand natural phenomena.",

    "comments": "A loud, quickly moving, cross-shapped aircraft emitting an extremely bright light  witness by myself along with my brothers and father  At about 11:50 pm, Eastern Time, on November 11th, 2012, my younger brothers noticed a bright orange light in the sky.  The light seemed to be about 500 feet away from our house, located behind my neighbor&#8217;s house.  They both immediately called my father and me. My dad was on the phone so I went to go look at the light from my brother&#8217;s bedroom window.  The light seemed to be stationary at first; however it slowly started moving to the north.  We called my father and he watched it with us for roughly two to three minutes.  The light again started moving a little further north for another minute.  Then it began to rise rather quickly. It seemed to be about 60 to 80 feet in the air.  Then it seemed that the light started to get bigger; however it began moving to the west, towards us.  It traveled extremely fast, crossing about 500 feet in a matter of 10 seconds.  As it traveled it produced an extremely loud humming sound.  As it approached our location the bright light seemed to die out! . It crossed in between mine and my neighbor&#8217;s house, so to get a better look I ran to the other bedroom down the hallway.  Once I got to the window I looked and seen that it was some sort of aircraft.  The aircraft seemed to be like a cross, with a triangular front.  It seemed to be about 30 feet long, and 15 feet wide.  The sides of the aircraft seemed to be very straight with a point at the end.  It had two antenna-like lights coming off the front end of it and another antenna-like light at the tail end of it.  The antennas were about 7 feet long with a diamond shape light at the end and the lights all a very bright red. At the front of the aircraft, there seemed to be some sort of headlights.  They were dim, but I was still able to notice them quite easily.  There were no lights on the sides of the craft. As the aircraft passed, the bright light it emitted turned on again.  It seemed to be almost like some sort of searchlight and was located behind the headlights.  As the aircraf! t kept traveling west, it just vanished. Almost like a quick f! ade out.  I do understand that it is a possibility that it could have been airplane of some sort, however there are a few airports only several miles away from where I live so I see many planes flying by all the time and never experienced any behaving in this fashion with such a bright light or moving with so much noise.   UPDATE: at 12:35 am ET, I heard the loud humming noise once again except I wasn&#8217;t able to locate the aircraft or where the sound was coming from. The noise lasted for about 35 seconds and seemed to be moving from north to south.   My brother took several photos of the aircraft and a video; however, it&#8217;s a small dot in the pictures and video. Although, you can see how bright the light is compared to the light my neighbor has on the side of his house.    P.S., the gentleman who answered the phone when I called was extremely rude.",

While I was laying in bed, trying to get to sleep, I noticed a strange pair of lights in the sky.  They were alternating like police lights, but they were a yellow color.  I did not think this was a ufo.  I thought it was strange, certainly.  But I thought maybe someone was in the courtyard (I live in an apartment complex) walking with a flashlight and that the light from the flashlight was reflecting off of my window frame.  However, the lights then did something I could not explain - they darted across the window within less than a second!

Every object basically did the same thing, line up, hover, and then proceed to the east, one after another.  They would move east, we lost them behind trees, and then just fade away into the sky as if they were planes in a distance with no navigation lights.  Every move they made seemed to be for a reason. After about 20 minutes of watching we decided to call the local Police.    An officer pulled up to us and watched for about 10 minutes and made comments such as, &quot;That's weird,&quot; and &quot;Maybe were under attack.&quot;  The officer pulled off in hopes of getting closer to the objec! ts.

Then smaller lights started appearing out of no where, and within 5 minutes went for smaller orange/red lights into these large lights hovering and would slowly move then stop and hover some more all while turning brighter and brighter and larger, almost like they were going to burst.  After getting extremely bright and large they would then get smaller and smaller and eventually turn into small plane lighting objects and fly northeast.  There were as many as 4-6 in the sky as once and when they changed and flew away more would come out of nowhere and repeat the cycle.

His first thought was Chinese lanterns, however, I've seen lanterns before but there was no way they were lanterns because of the distance they were incomparions to the brightness, as well as the way they were flying, stopping and changing shape.  He finally just said he doesn't know then, and said it was weird, and that he was going to drive closer to the area.  After about 50 mins no more appearing and we left.  They made no sound, and the strangest part was how they turned into what one might think are airplanes in the sky after being so larger and bright, almost like fireballs in the sky, but turning into planes and flying away, and the only! reason I keep saying plane like object is because of the way ! they loo ked like when they got small and flew away, they had a small red blinking light like planes do with a constant small white light.",

It left no trail behind, nor did it make a sound.  It was traveling at speeds that I never witnessed a manned aircraft before, hence it was only in view from my windshield for 5-6 seconds before it was out if sight.  It seemed to have a helicopter shape but was to fast to describe other than the gape of a teardrop.  The color was steady and did not change from the reddish orange light it emitted. It also was not bright but bright enough to catch my eye.",

I recorded a video of what could potentially have been a UFO at 3:30am on November 5, 2012 in Kenilworth, NJ area. I watched it sit completely still for over 10 minutes, before going in my house and grabbing my Nikon DLSR and my 300mm lens.  I zoomed in to the the max 300mm and recorded.  It was a good distance away and blocked partially by trees and branches.    Trying to get a better view I created some shaky video, but I assure you, this object sat completely still.  After recording it for 45 seconds, it took off in a fast and &amp;quot;looping swish&amp;quot; like motion.  (I lost the flying off in the viewfinder behind trees and house roofs, so sorry no footage of it.)   At first I thought it was a helicopter, but the complete stillness, the sounds it made and the vibrations I felt in my body, made me think it was not a helicopter at all.    I am the first one to consider logical explanations before making assumptions like this.  I have no idea what it is/was, but it was so! mething very strange in my opinion. What are your thoughts?",

We saw three orange glows in the sky.  At first, I thought it must be the sun or moon, but they were clearly distinct shapes and they were moving kind of toward the left and downward until they finally disappeared behind the houses in the distance.  I would say they were not some kind of optical illusion, nor did they appear to be some kind of reflection caused by the sun.  They were definitely not airplanes.  We then did some looking around online to see if anyone else had reported any similar sightings, and we found that there have been many reports in the last few years (one in my home town in Huntingdon, England) and others more locally.  Finally, we came across this website and decided to add our voice to the many others who say they have seen something.  I wouldn't like to say it was definitely something from outer space! Big claims require big evidence (or something like that) as someone once said. But they were definitely UFOs.",

I had just arrived home in Aurora, IL with my wife, mother-in-law and two girls right about 8:30 pm. It was already dark outside being that it was mid-November. We had groceries in the car that we had to unload them before my wife was to take her mother home in Naperville, IL.  So we all got out of the car, the girls went inside followed by the rest of us carrying the groceries. I came back outside by myself to get the rest of the groceries. As I walked down to the car that was parked in the middle of the driveway, I noticed an orange ball of light with blurry edges come to view on my left moving south to north in a perfectly straight line. It was moving at a pretty good speed and awfully low which is why I stayed fixated on it!  All of a sudden, a second identical ball of light showed up right behind it! By then, the first ball of light was right in front of me, but disappeared behind my neighbor&#8217;s house that was also in front of me. I then turned by attention to the 2nd ball of light that was following the first and I watched it as it began to move in front of me&#8230;.Just as I stayed transfixed on it, I noticed yet another ball of light pop up behind it that looked just like the first two and chasing the second ball of light. It was then that I knew that these were not planes! All I can say was that they were bright orange balls of light chasing one another. I then instantly realized that these were not planes! Planes simply do not behave like this; they do not chase each other in this manner or fly so low.   I then ran into the house through the garage and I frantically told my wife, who was in the kitchen, to come with me and to make it fast because I had to show her something before they disappeared. She was actually pretty startled by my sense of excitement. She came running out and I pointed out the two lights. By then, the 2nd ball of light had just began to peek out again from being out of view due to my neighbor&#8217;s house all while the 3rd ball of light was just about to be covered by my neighbor&#8217;s house.   Suddenly, we both then noticed that an identical 4th ball of light appeared flying in the same manner, path and height as the other 3 balls of lights that preceded it. All 4 objects looked identical, flew in the same speed and height all while following each other and were very low. They were so low that they should have made some noise, but they were perfectly silent. They made no sound whatsoever. They all appeared to by flying along US-30 which would put them over in Oswego, IL air space which is the direction I was facing. As all of the objects peeked out from behind my neighbor&#8217;s home, they changed their direction all heading west towards Oswego at which time they simply disappeared in the distance.   My wife and I were left dumbfounded by what we just witnessed. After the last light disappeared, we simply got the rest of the groceries and came back into the house. I was left intrigued by the whole experience and I began to look over the internet for any mentions of the same from other people in the area. Though I did not find any mentions of today&#8217;s sightings from other area people, I did stumble upon several internet sites, including this site, referencing similar/recent sightings of the same orange lights in Oswego, IL.",

There was a building obstructing my view so I walked a little quicker to get around it and that is when I saw a huge fire ball type object sitting in sky silently maybe as low as 10 stories up.  It looked like a mini sun that was just hovering there.  The middle of the huge buring object however was black and I noticed it looked like something in the middle of it was moving. When I got a better look it realized that in the middle of this burning ball of light was what appeared to be the shape of a human  only larger than any man that I have ever seen. I noticed the figure appeared to raise it's arms up then the fire around it started to get bigger and bigger and then it went from a still position to moving slowly away. Then It moved diagonally up and imploded on it's self! after making an enormous flash of light.",

Shortly after I stepped outside, I observed several (approximately 5 or 6) orange or red round objects in the sky to the north of our apartment.  For purposes of orientation, I can say that the objects were visible north of the intersection of Allen Rd. and Willow Knolls Rd. over that area&#8217;s car dealerships (Lexus, Toyota, Nissan).  The objects were in some sort of pattern, possibly a diamond shape.  At first I thought the pattern looked like a fireworks display of some sort, but I heard no explosions.  In fact, I did not hear any noise at all coming from the area.  I pointed the objects out to my wife and she began trying to take photos and video with my cellular phone.  Unfortunately, upon review of the video, the objects were not visible.  We also saw a male exit a vehicle up the road (unknown how many passengers we! re in the car) from our apartment to look at the objects, but we did not speak to each other.  As we continued to observe the objects in the sky, we noticed that some of the objects would suddenly fade away.  However, we also saw new orange/red round objects rising up from the ground in the same area north of our apartment.  While they were ascending, I noticed that the objects hovered in a manner that was somewhat similar to helicopters. But, I have never seen helicopters move quite like this and I can&#8217;t imagine why helicopters would be forming patterns in the sky at night.  The rising objects then joined the other objects before they also vanished.  By about 2305 hrs, all of the objects were gone.",

I probably missed a few because I was trying to record it with a cell phone camera that did not capture a thing.  The four lights seemed to launch from below and join the moving x, then all the lights that were forming the curved x disappeared. After that, only three were left that just moved upward north and vanished into the sky.  This beautiful occurrence lasted only 5 min.",

I was outside at work a few weeks back on our nightly break, when I saw a big green flash behind the clouds. It was very large in the sky. I was so shocked, I could barely express what I had seen.  That seemed to be the most significant thing to me, but I didn't feel like it was worth writing about until the last few nights.  On my way home from work, I drive down a strip of road with fields on both sides. Being fall time, they're really empty and easy to see across.  For the past few nights, I've noticed 2 bright orange balls of light on both the north and south horizons.  Very far out, but still noticeable from my car. The first night I thought they were interesting, and then I saw the same thing the second night.  The first night was very cloudy - couldn't see a star in the sky. I could however see these orange balls.  They weren't flashing or moving, just staying very still on the horizons.  Last night was exceptionally clear, and they were clearly visible in the same spots.  They are definitely a whole lot brighter than the rest of the things I could identify in the sky (stars, planes, etc).  On a possibly related note, I've noted a significant increase in the static electricity around here. I got shocked a whole bunch of times last night from doorknobs, in the same place I work every night. I know the time of year probably has something to do with it.  When I woke up this morning, 2 lightbulbs (maybe more?) in my house were dead.  The incandescent kind. Both are bulbs that get a LOT of use in the house, and could have coincidentally died at the same time. I just thought it was interesting.  As far as my (the observer) background goes...not much. I certainly am interested in UFO sightings, but have only ever seen a few times something I couldn't explain.  These few phenomenon in the past weeks have me puzzled, so I figured I'd say something - maybe other people have seen it too! :]   Thanks.",

I was scared shitless because I had just posted a post on GLP exposing what I know about how the illuminati uses subliminal pics of aliens in all us produced motion pictures.  It was an angry posting, and GLP took it down.  There's a big lake and I think it was coming down to take a look.  Scary, very scary.  I wanted to go back but given the circmstances, I couldn't.",

The object was in the distance and moved northeast, it seemed to dance freely with no definite flight path.    At one point my sister said there were 10 similar objects in the sky.    I focused on the main object with binoculars.  The lights had no definite shape and seemed to shift.   I believe it attracted 4 other white objects which made a triangular formation.

    "comments": "Silent V-Shaped Craft seen flying over Brooklyn NY!  I live in Brooklyn, New York.  Right across the East River in Williamsburg, giving me a clean shot of the Lower East Side, Manhattan and the surrounding skyline from the roof top of my apartment building.  To the Northeast I can see the Queens-based La Guardia airport and almost directly South is JFK.  I sit outside a few times every night to have a cigarette and pay very close attention to the sky and I know what conventional aircraft look like.  Since it&#8217;s NYC I&#8217;ve seen plenty of military craft as well, aircraft that the normal Joe-Schmoe doesn&#8217;t see every day.  Anything from F16 Fighter Jets, Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopters (when the President is in town), Chinook helicopters and once I even saw an Osprey flying over the East River Harbor.  Long story short, I&#8217;m very used to seeing unconventional craft in the sky as well.  I stepped outside onto my roof for a cigarette around 12:30am, as I normally do (since I don&#8217;t smoke inside my apartment) and when I looked up, I noticed how bright the stars were.  There aren&#8217;t many nights in New York City when the stars are visible.  There wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky and I was enjoying being able to see Orion&#8217;s Belt as I puffed away.  Then it came into my line of vision.  A very mysterious craft or UFO that flew directly over my head!  Now I can see planes flying into both Airports nearby and not once has any commercial flight flown directly overhead of my building.  If this craft was the size of a normal commercial flight, then it was flying at a severely low altitude.   It was very hard to comprehend the size, especially because there was no noise.  If it was a large commercial flight then it was way too low for FAA regulations, especially this close to Ground Zero (9/11).  The best explanation from what I directly witnessed, is it was flying at a high alt! itude and was just immensely huge, possibly the length of a football field.  It was in my line of vision for around 7-10 seconds before it disappeared behind the Williamsburg Bridge.  I ran down the fire escape on the side of my building praying that I would catch a glimpse of it again once it passed the bridge, or at least see some FAA lights.  Nothing.  It was gone, as so were my chances to photograph it.  The best way to describe it is the typical V-Shape that is pretty common in UFO sightings.  There were 5 lights.  One at the tip, then two down each side, perfectly symmetrical and at a perfect angle.  The lights were very large, circular and the light emitted was diffused, almost as if they were behind a haze.  Remember it was clear enough to see Orion&#8217;s Belt directly across from Manhattan, so it was a crystal clear night.  Other planes that were further away by miles had sharper looking lights and were more visible.   I was glad that I was looking at the stars or I would have never seen it because of how muted it was.  There were NO FAA lights on it whatsoever.  No headlights, no beacon lights, no red lights and definitely nothing flashing.  The lights that were present were a very soft white-yellowish color and did NOT flash. The body looked to follow the contours of the lights although it was hard to make out a solid surface.  It was almost like you could see through the! craft while just making out the signatures of its edges but I couldn&#8217;t see the stars behind it.  There was no sound what so ever.  It seemed to fly at a high speed very effortlessly.  When I had realized what I had seen it took my breath away.  My heart jumped straight up into my throat and I actually had a hard time breathing for a minute and I think I mumbled the &#8220;f&#8221; word to myself a few times.  I am 100% convinced that what I saw, I was not supposed to have seen.  It was very faint, lasted only for a few seconds, and was unlike anything I&#8217;ve ever seen in the night sky or in my life for that matter.  I&#8217;m not saying that it was extraterrestrial, but if it wasn&#8217;t then it was some sort of top-secret aircraft that hasn&#8217;t been disclosed by the government.  It is something that I will remember for the rest of my life.",

I was walking down Metropolitan Ave in the Bronx (Parkchester area)by the Macy's Department store.  I happened to look up at the sky and through a clearing in the clouds witnessed what appeared as two bright, orange glowing orbs flying in formation at a steady speed to the North-East. They did not make any sounds as attributed to regular aircraft.  There were no blinking lights as you would most likely see on regular aircraft.  I observed them for approximately 30 seconds moving through the clouds (the clouds would obscure them at times) until they started to move behind the buildings in the area and I lost sight of them.  As I tried to move to the other side of the street, I witnessed the third glowing orb flying the in the same direction, but far behind the other two bright glowing orbs.  At that point I called my brother in the Westchester Square area of the Bronx, and asked him to access the rooftop of his building to see see if he could observe what I was looking at.  He saw all three glowing orbs in the direction of Parchester as they flew in the same northeasterly direction, and continued to observe them until he lost visibility due to the cloud cover.  He also did not notice any blinking lights or sounds. I was a practicing amateur astronomer for several years, and I would not report this if I knew they were ordinary astronomical phenomena.  This was actually very unusual and I have never witnessed anything like this before.  Thank you.",

    "comments": "Rocking, slow moving disk high in sky visible due to reflected sunlight  I was traveling south on the New York State Thruway between exits 20 (Saugerties) and 19 (Kingston).  The sun was quite bright overhead - not visible to me.  Ahead of me were high flying clouds approaching from the south (they then totally dispersed, on the trip back they were nowhere to be seen.)  These were, again, HIGH flying clouds.  I was going 62 miles per hour (I know this because I watch my speedometer carefully and the car in front of me was a bit slower than usual).  I had reached (approximately) the mid-way point (mile marker 96-95) between Saugerties and Kingston exits which are eight miles from one another.  I&#8217;m unsure the exact direction since the road has many wide curves but it was the southbound lane (two lane thruway, I was in the right hand lane).  It was approximately 11:50 AM (I checked the car clock a couple of minutes later at 11:54).  I noticed a very bright, gleaming object reflecting sunlight.  It appeared in the sky immediately to my left in front of me (impossible to know how high it was.)  It was not low flying, it had no wings or rotors, and if it were at a cruising altitude of a commercial airliner, it would have been huge.  It flew much higher than a small plane could or any helicopter, it was not a dirigible or anything easily identifiable.  As directed, if I had to compare i! ts size to that of the sun (mid-day) it appeared flatter top and bottom, and perhaps 3/4 as wide.  It drifted &quot;slowly&quot; (in an easy manner) more toward the center of my windshield (this all took place in 7 to 10 seconds), stopped, rocked two times (like a plane rocking its wings) and slowly and smoothly went back to the original position.  It was metallic (which caused the sun to reflect off it as I stated) and shaped rather like a disc (saucer).  The road then curved widely and treed area came between me and that portion of the sky for several seconds (perhaps another eight) before I could get a glimpse of that piece of the sky again (which was extremely identifiable because of the formation of high flying clouds in an otherwise crystal blue sky).  The object was no longer visible.   When I reached my destination and parked, it so happened that the formation of clouds was directly in my line of vision.  I was able, standing still, to see that they were quite high.  A commercial jetliner was climbing to cruising altitude (I am 40 miles from both Albany and Newburgh airports, so planes climbing are commonly seen).  The plane appeared to be almost at cruising altitude and was quite high.  It entered the cloud structures and I lost sight of it.  I believe that the object I saw while driving also got &quot;lost&quot; into the cloud structure which explains why it was suddenly no longer visible (as the plane was suddenly no longer visible).  This suggests to me that the object I saw was flying as high as, or close to, the altitude of the commercial jetliner (since the same formation of clouds provided cover for both, once entered).   The most interesting aspect was the &quot;rocking,&quot; a lazy but precise maneuver, before it went back toward the direction where I had first seen it.  It was oval, as I said, rather like ( ) but with brackets top/bottom and very bright due to reflected sunlight.  It was obviously under control (the rocking indicates that to me) and was being deliberately maneuvered.   ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sincere in her description of her sighting.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD))",

    "comments": "Six Flaming Flying Objects - Identified - Case Closed  This is my 8th, and final, sighting event at Milford&#8217;s Gulf beach location.  Between 6:20-6:30PM, civil twilight, observed a series of six brilliant orange orbs ascending from the opposite shoreline, due west, and gliding SE.  Each light traveled about 1.5 miles at an altitude of about 250 ft before it disappeared from view and was replaced by another, aloft from the same location.  Through 10x25 Nikon binoculars I watched someone on the opposite beach involved in launching the last two of these lights.  Flashing a 5mW green laser in that direction seemed to have an affect: no further lights arose.  Immediately driving around the Milford marina to this opposite shore of the Gulf, I met a group of partiers around a bonfire who admitted to launching several kong ming type paraffin sky lanterns.  Two of these which failed to go aloft were still on the beach for me to examine.  MYSTERY SOLVED:  Milford obviously has more than its share of hot-air balloon/sky lantern users in various areas.  These are not necessarily hoaxers, mostly folks just out to have some fun.  The &#8220;swarm&#8221; of dozens of lights which I reported taking place on 10/13 originated from a sports bar/restaurant &#8211; some sort of celebration.  Therefore, to save others undue waste of time and effort, I offer&#8230; ANATOMY OF A FAUX UFO:  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A BRIGHT FLAMING ORB WITH A HAZE AROUND IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IF IT APPEARS CIRCULAR, BUT ALSO APPEARS TO CHANGE INTO A CYLINDER, OR HAVE A CYLINDER ATTACHED TO IT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IF IT LOOKS LIKE A CANDLE INSIDE A BUBBLE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IT IF RESEMBLES A FLARE ATTACHED TO A PARACHUTE, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IT THE BRIGHT LIGHT FLOATS OR GLIDES SOUNDLESSLY OVERHEAD ONLY TO FLICKER AND/OR SUDDENLY WINK OUT, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  IF IT SEEMS FLAME-LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS YELLOW-ORANGE-RED, AND ITS FLAME SEEMS TO BE SWAYING OR WAVERING, IT IS A SKY LANTERN.  I realize how unusual these things appear &#8211; particularly since I have witnessed some types of them being launched right in front of me, and still could not determine what I was observing after a two month lookout!  However, this is a very popular fad and these things are plentiful, easily available and cheap.  So expect more of them just about everywhere.  The truth shall set you free.",

Both my friend and I were outside getting a breath of fresh air and looking at the stars in the country when we saw a huge flickering amber light.  My friend asked me what star it was.  I said it didnt look like a star let alone a planet.  So we kept watching for at least another min or two and realized the object was moving up at a fairly good pace.  No other objects were noticed in the sky at the time.  But as we watched my friend turned to me and said wouldnt that be weird if it just disappeared?  I said well yeah!.  Just then we look back and its gone and several planes were seen around the same area. We rushed inside to tell more people but no one wanted to go outside in the cold.  And as we got back, it reapeared and then again disappeared for a second time.  Planes were all over the place flying in different directions and sometimes in a pattern together.  And they all were flying very very slowly.  These planes didnt make hardly a sound though either until they! were right above your head.",

It had a rather large tail behind it.  It was a bluish-greenish light, quite bright.  It fell very quickly; I saw it for approximately 2 seconds.    Suddenly, it came to a dead stop in the sky, while simultaneously turning red, as if it were a brake light. The red light appeared to be rather large and oval in shape.  This happened over a fraction of a second, then the object completely disappeared. I am curious to know what it could have been.",

I was with my 3 cousins making plans for the weekend when all of a sudden my cousin points out 2 or 3 shining dots that made a triangle shape.  It just hovered and we kept asking each other if it's possible for a plane to hover.  Then i started thinking if there are even planes shaped like that. Next thing you know, one by one the dots flew away FAST.  They flew away like 5 seconds apart but when they did, the sky lit up. It was creepy.   I'm certain others have seen it, but our community is filled with people who just don't care or assume they are fireworks.  Others would rather keep the info to themselves.

The orange fire orb moves silently through the cloudy night, a cool breeze passes by. Not a star or glance of moonlight in sight.   A single tree stands bare swaying through the light as it moves at a moderate rate of speed.  Glowing in the air it remains steady traveling northwest to southeast in an arc like motion while hovering far below the cloud line and peaking high above homes and farm land.

I took some pictures but they don&#8217;t do what I saw justice.  It looked like someone was tossing these balls into the atmosphere because they just gliding by, not far from the tree tops, and made no noise.  They were beautiful and I stood there in amazement watching them.  I can&#8217;t explain what they are but I know what I saw.  They were following each other sometimes just one and sometimes in a group of three.  They followed each other out to the west.   I am a pet groomer in Orlando and am always out with my dogs.

She was outside for about 3 mins and then she brought something to my attention.  She has a puzzled confused look on her face as she pointed up into the night sky and questioned what are those orange reddish glowing balls.  I then took a good look and came to a conclusion that they weren&#8217;t several things.  Such as candles, air planes, dragon fly&#8217;s.  I knew that they were something odd.  I had already had my camera with me at the time and I soon then called my parents out to determine what they were.  My dad gazed up into the sky to further examine what they were.  At the time all of this was taking place there was a sudden stop of air traffic.  I live right by an air port so planes are coming in and out at all hours.  I notice that there were only two dots side by side heading towards the clouds going east to west.  During this time I soon began to capture everything on camera because I knew you would ha! ve to see it to believe it.  And then a swarm of 5 or 6 followed it in the same path after it disappeared.  After that 1 more came right along in the same direction I closely examined it through my camera lens and I noticed that the orange light started to dim and right in the center was a orange reddish dot.  I took a closer look of the whole thing and I saw a clear  3D outline of what looked like the whole thing.  The best way I am can describe them is floating orange jelly fish.

I opened the back door to smoke a cigarette before going to bed and noticed a large bright set of white lights with red and green lights hovering beyond a tree break about a half mile from the house. This sparked my attention because I saw the same bright lights around the same day of the week and time of night last week.  I watched it hover for a long time and thought it could have been a helicopter because of how it was hovering and how low it was.  I stepped outside to see if I could hear it because if it was a helicopter, you would have definitely been able to hear it because it was so close.  I can make the helicopter sound comparison because of an aerial search conducted recently for an escaped convict from a local prison in which helicopters were used to search in our area.  The aircraft didn&#8217;t sound anything like the helicopter I heard several weeks ago and as a matter of fact, didn&#8217;t have a sound at all until it was flying overhead.  After several minutes, the aircraft began slowly moving closer and eventually flew directly over our house and was so low I could see it was a triangle shaped aircraft with lots of bright white lights and a green and red light.  If the aircraft had been a plane, you would have definitely been able to hear it as it was so low and so close but I couldn&#8217;t hear anything but what sounded like a plane that was flying at a high altitude, miles and miles above.  Once it flew over, I didn&#8217;t see anything else but will be looking from now on for sure.  I am a middle class working mother of one who works in a physician&#8217;s office and is educated.  I don&#8217;t use drugs and was not under the influence of medication or alcohol at the time of the sighting.  I have seen this object twice now and can&#8217;t deny what I saw was not like any aircraft I have ever seen even at all the airshows I went to as a child.",

    "comments": "Three brightly glowing objects above sun during sunset + Fireball 2 hours later.  A few minutes after apparent sunset on 11/7/2012 5:20-5:40 I saw an object begin glowing brightly about 6-7 degrees above the horizon, at this point 3 degrees above the sun (was obscured by tree line) the object was about the same angular size as Venus, maybe a little larger.  It was visible over the course of a minute, I first noticed it as a soft glowing object the same shade as the sun during sunset, but it got continuously brighter until I was able to see white light in the center, it quickly faded until it was just at the edge of my vision and then brightened up again.  During the phase where it brightened back up I noticed an identical object five degrees north of it, and 10 degrees above the horizon.  This one had a much shorter life cycle of about 20-30 seconds and did not re-ignite like the first object.  So transfixed was I on the second object that I did not notice what happened to the first.  After about two minutes of staring at the horizon trying to detect another I noticed a third object about 25 degrees directly above where the sun set, this one may have been in existence longer but I only saw it for about 5-10 seconds, which was enough time to point it out to a passerby to verify that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  She only noticed the contrail of a plane 10 degrees below object.  All three were exceptionally bright objects that did not move during the times they were visible (verified constantly with reference points on the Horizon), all presented with an orange glow similar to the surrounding sky during sunset, but they all at their peak brightness had a visible bright white core.  What I have concluded/believe:    1. They were not one object.  Two were visible at the same time.  2. It is not an airplane, or airplanes.  Angular size of light source, brightness and duration of visibility especially in close proximity to the sun would not exist without apparent motion.  3. They were not a satellite, positioning is too erratic, and they did not move. AND in order to produce a similar orange glow, light would have been reflected from the sun, but the objects were too close to the sun.  The only man-made objects to pass through area between sun and earth during time specified were ISS (ZARYA), Cosmos 2278, Atlas Centaur R/B and Okean-3.  None of which, according to computer program Stellarium 0.11.3, were in proper position or at proper times to be the objects spotted.  My mind first jumped to supernova, and second to aliens.  Both seem equally improbable.

Angular size equivalent to quarter held at arm&#8217;s length.  No one else in my immediate vicinity appeared to have noticed it.  Highly visible fragmentation, with a short tail roughly equal to that of the body size, there was no noise.  Location of viewer during sighting: +28&#176; 25' 5.35&amp;quot;, -81&#176; 34' 49.88&amp;quot; (28.418152, -81.580522)  (Locations calculated via Google maps)",

I went got in my car and two objects were hoovering in the sky on top of my car they followed me from my house down to walmart on edgewood road, then to the guppys on the go on edgewood,    I rolled down my window to make sure i was not seeing things, i wasnt they were hoovering high but directly over my car they were moving fast they were yellow light balls, moving fast and almost blinking, hovering over my car, moving so fast I knew they were following me. i was very scared i got back in my car and i went to the caseys on collins they followed me there, then i kept driving and they eventually disappeared.  I then wen home to call my father and i felt as though they were hovering over my house although i did not see them..... My phone was rejecting calls to my father which my dad has never nor never wold restrict my calls, there was t! remendous scrambling on the phone.  It rejected my phone call to him about 9 times. then i woudl get phone calls and i would answer and it would be all scrambly. I KNOW FOR A FACT WHATEVER I SEEN WAS DOIGN THIS.    I did eventually call my dad on that phone and he was no longer rejecting my phone calls. It seemed as though it was something different every time one time it would be rejected and another time it was no longer in service, which my father has an answering machine.  I truly believe  whatever i seen was of a demonic force and was very upset to my testimony of Jesus Christ.  I do know in the book of ezikel there are these objects seen by him as well.  I am not sure if this was demonic or of something of that manner. I know i seen what i saw i always thought ufos were fake.  THEY INDEED ARE NOT.  i believe whatever it is can watch things. this happened after a testimony on facebook and rember about my phone line. whatever they are have the power of technology.",

Then I noticed that it was moving all over the sky, right, left, up, down. I ran inside to get a blanket, and ran back out and it was still there. It would get closer at times, and it would occasionally stop and hover. I could see that it could be a spear shape, with the light in the center and coming from the center there were long lines, as if connecting on the outer rim. I wasn't sure what I was seeing, and kept watching it for an hour, going around the sky, getting closer then further away. When I did get to see it, it looked like some sort of craft, honestly. I don't know how to describe it. It was dark and I could only see so much. I did see a plane fly by and pass by it.

She pointed out a cluster of lights in the sky and asked my if I could see them and if they were stars.  I looked to where she was pointing and at a glance what I saw did appear to be stars of constellations.  As I continued to look at these lights I noticed that they appeared to be moving.  The lights were not maintaining the pattern they were in when I first looked at them.  They also seemed to be much closer in distance than what most stars look like.  I looked around in different directions and noticed that there were not any actual stars out yet.  These lights were the only lights in the sky.  We arrived at our destination and got out of the car for a better view.  The lights appeared to be moving in a north/northwest direction.  They looked as if they were flashing red and white.  At first, when we first saw the lights, there were about 20 to 30 lights.  When we were out of the car there were only about 10 to 15.  As we were watching the remaining lights, the lights were moving and would just disappear.  Two more individual lights appeared in my peripheral vision, coming out from the south over some trees.  These lights did not make it as far across my view point before vanishing.  All of the lights observed while outside of the car seemed to be as close in distance as a local airplane might be if flying through the sky.  Definitely within the Earth's atmosphere.  Thought these might be related to the meteor shower that was being reported to be taking place, but there were no streaks or tails and they were not moving very fast.  Tried to get a photo taken with camera phone.  Zoomed in to 4x zoom.  The image at that zoom level was a fuzzy red dot and that dot was about a quarter of an inch wide.

The sky was 100% cloudy, with rain from time to time. Stars and the moon were not visible due to the storm clouds covering the area.  As I traveled south a bright colorful light (blue, green mostly) began to flash within the clouds making the surrounding clouds light up with different colors. I thought this very strange and kept watching as suddenly I could clearly make out several round lights begin to take form from within the clouds.  Like the sun shining through thick clouds during the day, theses lights seemed to be the same size, giving the illusion that it was no higher up than a water tower, but I knew from the foggy mist overlapping the lights that the object was higher up. The lights were now solid and the pulsing flash had stopped.  Theses lights were perfectly spaced from one another giving me the idea that they were apart of one solid object. I could not make out the shape d! ue to the object clearly being deep within the clouds above but the lights were so bright that they shined through with no problem.  The object was moving incredible slow about the same speed as you would see a flock of geese travel.  I quickly decided to pull over and try to video tape it with my phone. As I got out the object was moving slowly over me heading west, for as low as it seemed to be the object put off no sound.  The lights were now  brightly white and were round in shape.  As I watched the object travel above, it presented itself to me with a natural flow, like it belonged in the sky.  I began to try and film the object but my phone could not focus on the lights or anything else in the dark.  The object then began to disappear in some thicker clouds and the lights began to fade away until I could not see them anymore. I stood on the side of the road for 30 more seconds and the pulses began to appear again but further in the distance.    (Lights formed a honey comb shape with another light in the center)    First draft i tried to make honey comb shape but after i sent it the shape then turned into a line. the object was a honey comb, pentagon shape.",

    "comments": "Flying in a Cessna 182 North of LaBelle VOR, encounter strange light not on radar.  Just spent 20 minutes on the phone with Miami ARTCC (Center); would love anyone's insight here.  Bear with me, kind of a long, detailed story:  Flew back from FXE to TPF direct with my student tonight.  All of the Avon Park MOA's and Restricted areas were active/hot, and we could see about 6 F-16's (as per Miami center) dog fighting and practicing intercept procedures at 7000' and above.  Upon clearing the MOA and due east of Arcadia, what appeared to be a LED landing light abruptly popped on just above the cloud layer and immediately caught our attention.  It appeared to be about 500ft below us, at our 2 o'clock and figured about 5-7 miles, and looked as if it might be in conflict in a few minutes.  The light then started flashing, presumably because he saw us up ahead crossing and wanted to make his position known.  I turned on our landing and taxi light of the 182 to acknowledge, yet this other aircraft kept turning this light on at odd and random intervals until he went dark for about a minute.  Fed up, I asked the Miami controller for a traffic advisory on the aircraft at our 2 o'clock and about 3-4 miles.  He responded that he didn't observe any traffic in the area.  A little puzzled, I asked him if he had any primary targets in the area and he told me to standby.  A long 15 seconds passed by and the light appeared again!  This time it appeared to now be at our 1 o'clock but the light still pointed at us (?) and then quickly went out again.  The controller came back on and said that he had checked and rechecked his backup systems and assured me that there were NO primary(pure radar return) targets in the area.  Just when he said that, an aircraft behind us a few miles asked where we were, the controller told him, and that pilot reported that he was watching all of this happen AS well!  Then a third aircraft also chimed in and said he too was seeing the strange light and it was moving across the sky rapidly.  Three aircraft in all saw this.  The controller was completely bewildered at this point....needless to say, upon landing, I called up Miami Center.  I talked on the phone for 20 minutes to the D-Side of the sector I was in, who turned out to be a supervisor and was training the R-Side.  He too was sufficiently freaked out and confused along with the rest of the guys on &quot;the floor.&quot;   He said that in his 27 years, he had odd occurrences like this every few years and they usually turned out to be flares IN the MOA but never in this location, intermittent, and underneath another aircraft moving laterally.  He thought that it was a UAV (which is of course illegal to operate in the NAS), and that if it was, it could have been much closer to our aircraft than we had thought (that's always comforting to hear) and it would also explain why it was not on their radar if it was small enough.  I chimed in and figured that it started turning its lights on and off in an effort to avoid us.  This was not a flare or laser.  It changed position laterally and maintained its altitude.",

As it moved it passed in front of some stars.  It didn't block them out but they were not clearly visible either.  Instead the star light seemed disrupted as it passed over them, like looking through moving water.  The thought occurred to me afterward that it looked like the cloaked effect used in sci-fi movies.  It was dead quiet outside and there was no sound.  Waited to hear a delayed jet sound but there was nothing.  I'm not ruling out meteors but this was like nothing I have ever seen.

    "comments": "3 Bright Red Lights in a Triangle Formation  At approximately 11:45pm central time on November 3rd I went out into my front porch to smoke a cigarette.  I was looking east when I noticed a bright orange/red light in the sky.  Upon a second look I noticed two more identical lights.  The lights were aligned like the 3 points of a triangle.  I could not see a solid object between the lights but the way they moved together made me believe they were part of a solid object.  The lights were above the tree line and appeared to be very close to me.  I was worried that while I was sitting there the object/lights were going to fly over my house.  They appeared to be much lower than an airplane would fly.  I would estimate that they were approximately 100-200 feet in the air, maybe higher but definitely below the light cloud cover.   I remember thinking that when the object flew over, it was so low that I would be able to see all the detail and that frightened me.  The lights were gliding very slowly, not wavering from their position in the triangle and moving in a westerly direction.  The lights were circular in shape and were about 5 times brighter and larger than the brightest/largest star in the sky.  I watched the lights for about 10 minutes as they moved west, toward me, then they began to slowly fade until they appeared no brighter or larger than the average star.  I wish, in retrospect, that I had grabbed my camera but I was too scared/in awe to go get it while the event was happening.  After the lights faded I immediately went inside and woke my husband but it was too late, they were gone.  I am a 30 year old mother of two with a 4 year degree from a reputable university.  I am an admitted skeptic.  I have never witnessed anything like this before.",

I live only 6 miles from the Kansas City airport so I am accustomed to seeing planes takeoff and land. I looked at it for a time and realized that it was making jerky movements preceded by a green flash. It was a light at high altitude, crescent shaped.    I watched it for half an hour and it moved repeatedly, then I sighted two more in the southwest sky. I also witnessed what appeared to be planes with red and white flashing strobes, and I assumed that it was military observation of the phenomenon.    Then I sighted two more in the southern sky.  After 22:00 the lights from a nearby shopping center were dimmer and I was able to see more right overhead and in the eastern sky.  I became unable to count accurately due to the number of UFOs in the skies.  Until last night, November 6, 2012, election night, I have been a skeptic and now I am a believer. I phoned my sister in Syracuse, NY, who is professor emeritus SUNY, during this sighting, since she attends UFO conferences and is a staunch believer.    She questioned me and was sure that I was in fact witnessing an event.    They looked different from stars which appear as a bright light that twinkles sometimes and do not move in the manner of water bugs on surface tension on a body of water like these objects did.    I am not sure of the exact duration of the event, because the election coverage was on TV and I went inside to see who was elected. I ceased watching at 22:00 and went back out at 00:30 and they were no longer there. The constellations had changed position, but that was all I saw in the skies by that time.",

    "comments": "Low-flying, shape-changing aircraft seen in a small Southern Louisiana town.  My mother, aunt, cousin, boyfriend and I were driving up my street earlier to go to a fair.  My mom, who is a skeptic on such things, stops the car when she sees a low-flying craft right nearby.  It was dark, so we couldn't see much except for changing, flashing lights.   The lights came from different areas of the craft, and it looked a bit like a trapezoid, but then seemed to change shape.   Getting out of the car, there was a quiet drone unlike anything I've heard before.   Soon it started flying away at incredible speed.  That's the second UFO I see close to my home, and to think so live in a town so small, most maps don't even recognize it.",

    "comments": "UFO's fly by festival in Cape Coral Florida on 11/10/2012  There were about 17-20 orb shaped lights or giant glowing balls of light (hard to say how large since if they were 1/4 a mile away I would guess the size of a basketball. They may have been a few miles away then they would be the size of a car. They were in a group of four about 20ft apart then a few ain a row then another group. They had an orange glow and were organized as to how they maved across the sky. It took 5 to 10 minutes to complete.  We were at a festival that night and everyone that saw this was amazed.  There were thousands of people at the fair and with all the confusion of a fair people may have missed it but I'm pretty sure lots of the people saw this and just don't know how to report it.",

About 10 red and white flashing spheres, spaced apart, moving across the sky quickly from south to north, then turning west to go out over the Gulf of Mexico.

    "comments": "Super bright orangish red shooting flame across the sky in Cape Coral, FL  On November 7th, 2012, I was driving home from picking up my 14 year old son at a friend&#8217;s.  We were sitting at a light at Burnt Store and Pine Island Rd when we both looked up and saw what we thought was a shooting star.    I remember stating that it was the brightest shooting star I have ever seen.  It was so big and bright like it was SUPER close.  But the direction that it traveled was very odd it went in a 45 degree angle across the sky for a few seconds and then disappeared.  It was so strange that for the past week I have not been able to forget about it.",

    "comments": "Two metallic spheres moving west over then south over Boynton Beach  Driving north on Congress Avenue about 1/2 mile south of Hypoluxo Blvd, I saw two spherical objects moving west through the sky. At first I thought they were small passenger planes from the local airfield, but didn't see any wings. They glinted in the sun, the same bare-metal color and reflection as a WWII Mustang fighter plane.  My second thought was that they were party balloons flying thorugh the air. But as I got closer they appeared to be too big - about 10 feet in diameter. After passing over Congress Ave they continued on then turned south and kept going parallel with the street behind me. They disappeared behind the trees, and I turned around at Hypoluxo Blvd to go back south and try to catch them on my camera, but never saw them again. They were in view for perhaps 30 seconds, starkly visible against the bright blue sky and cumulous clouds.  They appeared to be about 200-300 years away at the beginning, and maybe 50-75 yards up. They kept their formation the whole time, one higher and ahead of the other. I couldn't tell if it was directly in front of the other or not. I was in the car in traffic and heard no sound from the spheres.   ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

Looked up into the sky to check out the stars.  I observed a huge, boomerang shaped object moving from North to South.  I pointed it out to my friend.  At first, I thought that it was a formation of birds since the shape was somewhat of a Vee, but with rounded edges.  However, it was dark and birds don&#8217;t usually fly in formation, at night.  There were no visible lights on the object.  It moved silently, high above the cirrus clouds which were at a very high altitude.  Commercial airline traffic was in the air, at much lower altitudes.  These aircraft were dwarfed by the object that we observed. We were amazed at the size of this flying object or formation.  It moved at a very high speed and, within 45 to 60 seconds it could no longer be seen.",
